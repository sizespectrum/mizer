# mizer

mizer is a package that implements size-based ecological models.
The package has been developed to model marine ecosystems that are subject
to fishing. However, it may also be appropriate for other ecosystems.

The package contains routines and methods to allow users to set up the model
community, and then project it through time under different fishing
strategies.

Methods are included to explore the results, including plots and 
calculation of community indicators such as the slope of the size spectrum.
Size-based models can be complicated so mizer contains many default
options that can be easily changed by the user.

See the accompanying vignette, "mizer_vignette", for more details on how
the package works including detailed examples.

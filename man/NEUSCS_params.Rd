\description{
Created with purely size-based predation, i.e., no species-specific interactions. 
Set up with three fishing gears targeting small, medium and large species. 
Vulnerabilities are represented by changing the clearance rate constant (gamma) between species.
Calibrated to efforts
\code{effort = c(small=0.4, medium=0.3, large=0.25)}.

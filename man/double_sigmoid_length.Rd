\usage{
double_sigmoid_length(w, l25, l50, l50_right, l25_right, species_params, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{the size of the individual.}

\item{l25}{the length which gives a selectivity of 25\%.}

\item{l50}{the length which gives a selectivity of 50\%.}

\item{l50_right}{the length which gives a selectivity of 50\%.}

\item{l25_right}{the length which gives a selectivity of 25\%.}

\item{species_params}{A list with the species params for the current species.
Used to get at the length-weight parameters \code{a} and \code{b}}

\item{...}{Unused}

\description{
A hump-shaped selectivity function with a sigmoidal rise and an independent
sigmoidal drop-off. This drop-off is what distinguishes this from the
function \code{\link[=sigmoid_length]{sigmoid_length()}} and it is intended to model the escape
of large individuals from the fishing gear.
}
\details{
The selectivity is obtained as the product of two sigmoidal curves, one
rising and one dropping. The sigmoidal rise is based on the two parameters
\code{l25} and \code{l50} which determine the length at which 25\% and 50\%
of the stock is selected respectively. The sigmoidal drop-off is based on the
two parameters \code{l50_right} and \code{l25_right} which determine the
length at which the selectivity curve has dropped back to 50\% and 25\%
respectively.

As the size-based model is weight based, and this
selectivity function is length based, it uses the
length-weight parameters \code{a} and \code{b} to convert between length and weight.

\usage{
valid_species_arg(object, species = NULL, return.logical = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A MizerSim or MizerParams object from which the species
should be selected.}

\item{species}{The species to be selected. Optional. By default all target
species are selected. A vector of species names, or a
numeric vector with the species indices, or a logical vector indicating for
each species whether it is to be selected (TRUE) or not.}

\item{return.logical}{Whether the return value should be a logical vector.
Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
A vector of species names, in the same order as specified in the
'species' argument. If 'return.logical = TRUE' then a logical vector is
returned instead, with length equal to the number of species, with
TRUE entry for each selected species.
}
\description{
If the species argument contains invalid species, then these are
ignored but a warning is issued.

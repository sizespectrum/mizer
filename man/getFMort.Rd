\title{Get the total fishing mortality from all fishing gears by time, species and
size.}
\usage{
getFMort(object, effort, ...)

\S4method{getFMort}{MizerParams,numeric}(object, effort, ...)

\S4method{getFMort}{MizerParams,matrix}(object, effort, ...)

\S4method{getFMort}{MizerSim,missing}(object, effort,
  time_range = dimnames(object@effort)$time, drop = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{MizerParams} object or a \code{MizerSim} object}

\item{effort}{The effort of each fishing gear. Only needed if the object
argument is of class \code{MizerParams}. See notes below.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{getFMortGear} method.}

\item{time_range}{Subset the returned fishing mortalities by time. The time
range is either a vector of values, a vector of min and max time, or a
single value. Default is the whole time range. Only used if the
\code{object} argument is of type \code{MizerSim}.}

\item{drop}{Only used when object is of type \code{MizerSim}. Should
dimensions of length 1 be dropped, e.g. if your community only has one
species it might make presentation of results easier. Default is TRUE}
}
\value{
An array. If the effort argument has a time dimension, or object is
  of class \code{MizerSim}, the output array has three dimensions (time x
  species x size). If the effort argument does not have a time dimension, the
  output array has two dimensions (species x size).
}
\description{
Calculates the fishing mortality from all gears by species and size at each
time step in the \code{effort} argument.
The total fishing mortality is just the sum of the fishing mortalities
imposed by each gear.

\code{getFMort} method for \code{MizerParams} object with constant effort.

\code{getFMort} method for \code{MizerParams} object with time changing effort.

\code{getFMort} method for \code{MizerSim} object.
}
\note{
Here: fishing mortality = catchability x selectivity x effort.

The \code{effort} argument is only used if a \code{MizerParams} object is
passed in. The \code{effort} argument can be a two dimensional array (time x
gear), a vector of length equal to the number of gears (each gear has a
different effort that is constant in time), or a single numeric value (each
gear has the same effort that is constant in time). The order of gears in the
\code{effort} argument must be the same the same as in the \code{MizerParams}
object.

If the object argument is of class \code{MizerSim} then the effort slot of the \code{MizerSim} object is used and the \code{effort} argument is not used.

object.

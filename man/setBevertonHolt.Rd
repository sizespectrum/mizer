\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}
Takes a MizerParams object \code{params} with arbitrary density dependence and
returns a MizerParams object with Beverton-Holt density-dependence with your
chosen reproductive efficiency or your chosen maximal reproduction rate.
If you have tuned your \code{params} object to describe a particular steady state,
then setting the Beverton-Holt density dependence with this function will
leave you with the exact same steady state, because it only allows you to
choose among those Beverton-Holt reproduction curves that have the property
that the energy invested into reproduction by the mature individuals leads to
the reproduction rate that is required to maintain the given egg abundance.
By specifying one of the parameters \code{erepro}, \code{R_max} or \code{reproduction_level}
you pick the desired reproduction curve. More details of these parameters are
provided below.

\details{
With Beverton-Holt density dependence the relation between the energy
invested into reproduction and the number of eggs hatched is determined
by two parameters: the reproductive efficiency \code{erepro} and the maximum
reproduction rate \code{R_max}.

If no maximum is imposed on the reproduction rate
(\eqn{R_{max} = \infty}{R_max = Inf}) then the resulting density-independent
reproduction rate \eqn{R_{di}}{R_di} is proportional
to the total rate \eqn{E_R} at which energy is invested into reproduction,
\deqn{R_{di} = \frac{\rm{erepro}}{2 w_{min}} E_R,}{R_di = (erepro/(2 w_min)) E_R,}
where the proportionality factor is given by the reproductive efficiency
\code{erepro} divided by the egg size \code{w_min} to convert energy to egg number and
divided by 2 to account for the two sexes.

Imposing a finite maximum reproduction rate \eqn{R_{max}}{R_max} leads to a
non-linear relationship between energy invested and eggs hatched. This
density-dependent reproduction rate \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} is given as
\deqn{R_{dd} = R_{di}
\frac{R_{max}}{R_{di} + R_{max}}.}{R_dd = R_di R_max/(R_di + R_max).}

(All quantities in the above equations are species-specific but we dropped
the species index for simplicity.)

The following plot illustrates the Beverton-Holt density dependence in the
reproduction rate for two different choices of parameters.
\figure{Beverton-Holt-plot-1.png}

This plot shows that a given energy \eqn{E_R} invested into reproduction can
lead to the same reproduction rate \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} with different choices
of the parameters \code{R_max} and \code{erepro}. \code{R_max} determines the asymptote of
the curve and \code{erepro} its initial slope. A higher \code{R_max} coupled with a
lower \code{erepro} (black curves) can give the same value as a lower \code{R_max}
coupled with a higher \code{erepro} (blue curves).

For the given initial state in the MizerParams object \code{params} one can
calculate the energy \eqn{E_R} that is invested into reproduction by the
mature individuals and the reproduction rate \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} that is
required to keep the egg abundance constant. These two values determine the
location of the black dot in the above graph. You then only need one
parameter to select one curve from the family of Beverton-Holt curves going
through that point. This parameter can be \code{erepro} or \code{R_max}. Instead of
\code{R_max} you can alternatively specify the \code{reproduction_level} which is the
ratio between the density-dependent reproduction rate \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} and
the maximal reproduction rate  \eqn{R_{max}}{R_max}.

The parameter you provide can be either a vector with one value for each
species, or a named vector where the names determine which species are
affected, or a single unnamed value that is then used for all species. Any
species for which the given value is \code{NA} will remain unaffected.

The values for \code{R_max} must be larger than \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} and can range
up to \code{Inf}. If a smaller value is requested a warning is issued and the
value is increased to the value required for a reproduction level of 0.99.

The values for the \code{reproduction_level} must be positive and
less than 1. The values for \code{erepro} must be large enough to allow the
required reproduction rate. If a smaller value is requested a warning is
issued and the value is increased to the smallest possible value. The values
for \code{erepro} should also be smaller than 1 to be physiologically sensible,
but this is not enforced by the function.

As can be seen in the graph above, choosing a lower value for \code{R_max} or a
higher value for \code{erepro} means that near the steady state the reproduction
will be less sensitive to a change in the energy invested into reproduction
and hence less sensitive to changes in the spawning stock biomass or its
energy income. As a result the species will also be less sensitive to
fishing, leading to a higher F_MSY.

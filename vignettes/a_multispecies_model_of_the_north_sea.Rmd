In this section we try to pull everything together with an extended example of a
multispecies model for the North Sea. First we will set up the model, project it
through time using historical levels of fishing effort, and then examine the
results. We then run two different future projection scenarios.


## Setting up the North Sea model

The first job is to set up the `MizerParams` object for the North Sea model.
In the previous multispecies examples we have already been using the
life-history parameters and the interaction matrix for the North Sea model. We
will use them again here but will make some changes. In particular we set up the
fishing gears differently.

The species in the model are: 
`r paste(NS_species_params[,"species"], collapse=", ")`,
which account for about 90% of the total biomass of all species sampled by
research trawl surveys in the North Sea. The `NS_species_params` object that
comes as an example with the mizer package is a
data.frame with columns for `species`, `w_inf`, `w_mat`, `beta`, `sigma`,
`k_vb` and `R_max`.
```{r}
NS_species_params
```


We have seen before that only having these columns in the species data.frame is
sufficient to make a `MizerParams` object. Any missing columns will be 
filled with default values by the `MizerParams` constructor. For example, the
data.frame does not include columns for `h` or `gamma`. This means that they
will be estimated using the `k_vb` column.

We will use the default density dependence in the reproduction rate, which is the
Beverton-Holt shape. This requires a column `R_max` in the species data.frame
which contains the maximum reproduction rate for each species. This column is
already in the `NS_species_params` data.frame. The values were found through a
calibration process which is not covered here but will be described in a
separate tutorial.

At the moment we are not providing any information on the
selectivity of the gears for the species. By default, the selectivity function
is a knife-edge which only takes a single argument, `knife_edge_size`. In this
model we want the selectivity pattern to be a sigmoid shape which more
accurately reflects the selectivity pattern of trawlers in the North Sea. The
sigmoid selectivity function is expressed in terms of length rather than weight
and uses the parameters `l25` and `l50`, which are the lengths at which 25% and
50% of the stock is selected. The length based sigmoid selectivity looks like:

\begin{equation}
%     {#eq:trawl_sel}
    S_l = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(S1 - S2\ l)}
\end{equation}

where $l$ is the length of an individual, $S_l$ is the selectivity at length,
$S2 = \log(3) / (l50 - l25)$ and $S1 = l50 \cdot S2$.

This selectivity function is included in mizer as `sigmoid_length()`. You can
see the help page for more details. As the mizer model is weight based, and this
selectivity function is length based, it uses the length-weight parameters `a`
and `b` to convert between length and weight using the standard relation $w = a
l^b$. These species parameters need to be added as columns to the
`NS_species_params` data frame.
```{r}
NS_species_params$a <- c(0.007, 0.001, 0.009, 0.002, 0.010, 0.006, 0.008, 0.004,
                      0.007, 0.005, 0.005, 0.007)
NS_species_params$b <- c(3.014, 3.320, 2.941, 3.429, 2.986, 3.080, 3.019, 3.198,
                      3.101, 3.160, 3.173, 3.075)
```

`sigmoid_length()` has the arguments `l25` and `l50`. As explained in 
[the section on fishing gears and selectivity](multispecies_model.html#sec:fishing_gear), 
the arguments of the selectivity function need to be in the gear parameter data
frame. We also need a column specifying the name of the selectivity function we
wish to use. Note it would probably be easier to put this data into a
*.csv file and then read it in rather than type it in by hand like we do here:

```{r label=adding_sel_params}
gear_params <- 
    data.frame(species = NS_species_params$species,
               gear = NS_species_params$species,
               sel_func = "sigmoid_length",
               l25 =  c(7.6, 9.8, 8.7, 10.1, 11.5, 19.8, 16.4, 19.8, 11.5,
                        19.1, 13.2, 35.3),
               l50 = c(8.1, 11.8, 12.2, 20.8, 17.0, 29.0, 25.8, 29.0, 17.0,
                       24.3, 22.9, 43.6))
gear_params
```

Note that we have set up a `gear` column so that each species will be caught by
a separate gear named after the species.

In this model we are interested in projecting forward using historical fishing
mortalities. The historical fishing mortality from 1967 to 2010 for each species
is stored in the csv file `NS_f_history.csv` included in the package. As before,
we can use `read.csv()` to read in the data. This reads the data in as a
`data.frame`. We want this to be a `matrix` so we use the `as()` function:

```{r label=show_load_f_history}
f_location <- system.file("extdata", "NS_f_history.csv", package = "mizer")
f_history <- as(read.csv(f_location, row.names = 1), "matrix")
```

We can take a look at the first years of the data:
```{r label=head_f_history}
head(f_history)
```

Fishing mortality is calculated as the product of selectivity, catchability and
fishing effort. The values in `f_history` are absolute levels of fishing
mortality. We have seen that the fishing mortality in the `mizer` simulations is
driven by the fishing effort argument passed to the `project()` function.
Therefore if we want to project forward with historical fishing levels, we need
to provide `project()` with effort values that will result in these historical
fishing mortality levels.

One of the model parameters that we have not really considered so far is
`catchability`. Catchability is a scalar parameter used to modify the fishing
mortality at size given the selectivity at size and effort of the fishing gear.
By default catchability has a value of 1, meaning that an effort of 1 results in
a fishing mortality of 1 for a fully selected species. When considering the
historical fishing mortality, one option is therefore to leave catchability at 1
for each species and then use the `f_history` matrix as the fishing effort.
However, an alternative method is to use the effort relative to a chosen
reference year. This can make the effort levels used in the model more
meaningful. Here we use the year 1990 as the reference year. If we set the
catchability of each species to be the same as the fishing mortality in 1990
then an effort of 1 in 1990 will result in the fishing mortality being what it
was in 1990. The effort in the other years will be relative to the effort in
1990.

```{r label=set_catchability}
gear_params$catchability <- as.numeric(f_history["1990",])
```

Considering the other model parameters, we will use default values for all of
the other parameters apart from `kappa`, the carrying capacity of the resource
spectrum (see [see the section on resource density](model_description.html#resource-density)). 
This was estimated along with the values `R_max` as part of the calibration
process.

We now have all the information we need to create the `MizerParams` object using
the species parameters data.frame.

```{r label=make_ns_params, results='hide'}
params <- newMultispeciesParams(NS_species_params, 
                                interaction = inter, 
                                kappa = 9.27e10,
                                gear_params = gear_params)
```

## Setting up and running the simulation

As we set our catchability to be the level of fishing mortality in 1990, before
we can run the projection we need to rescale the effort matrix to get a matrix
of efforts relative to 1990. To do this we want to rescale the `f_history`
object to 1990 so that the relative fishing effort in 1990 = 1. This is done
using R function `sweep()`. We then check a few rows of the effort matrix to
check this has happened:

```{r label=rescale_effort}
relative_effort <- sweep(f_history,2,f_history["1990",],"/")
relative_effort[as.character(1988:1992),]
```

We could just project forward with these relative efforts. However, the
population dynamics in the early years will be strongly determined by the
initial population abundances (known as the transient behaviour - essentially
the initial behaviour before the long term dynamics are reached). As this is
ecology, we don't know what the initial abundance are. One way around this is to
project forward at a constant fishing mortality equal to the mortality in the
first historical year until equilibrium is reached. We then use this steady
state as the initial state for the simulation. This approach reduces
the impact of transient dynamics.

```{r}
params <- projectToSteady(params, effort = relative_effort["1967", ])
```

We now have our parameter object and out matrix of efforts relative to 1990.
We use this effort
matrix as the `effort` argument to the `project()` function. We use `dt` = 0.25
(the simulation will run faster than with the default value of 0.1, but tests
show that the results are still stable) and save the results every year.

```{r label=project_ns_model}
sim <- project(params, effort = relative_effort, dt = 0.25, t_save = 1)
```

Plotting the results, we can see how the biomasses of the stocks change over
time.

```{r label = plot_ns_biomass}
plotBiomass(sim)
```

To explore the state of the community it is useful to calculate indicators of
the unexploited community. Therefore we also project forward to the steady state
with 0 fishing effort.

```{r label=unexploited_na}
sim0 <- projectToSteady(params, effort = 0, return_sim = TRUE)
```

## Exploring the model outputs

Here we look at some of the ways the results of the simulation can be explored.
We calculate the community indicators ``mean maximum weight``, ``mean individual
weight``, ``community slope`` and the `large fish indicator` (LFI) over the
simulation period, and compare them to the unexploited values. We also compare
the simulated values of the LFI to a community target based on achieving a high
proportion of the unexploited value of the LFI of $0.8 LFI_{F=0}$.

The indicators are calculated using the functions described in 
[the section about indicator functions](exploring_the_simulation_results.html#functions-for-calculating-indicators).
Here we calculate the LFI and the other community indicators for the unexploited
community. When calculating these indicators we only include demersal species
and individuals in the size range 10 g to 100 kg, and the LFI is based on
species larger than 40 cm. Each of these functions returns a time series. We are
interested only in the equilibrium unexploited values so we just select the
final time step.

```{r label=ns_comm_ref_point}
demersal_species <- c("Dab", "Whiting", "Sole", "Gurnard", "Plaice",
                      "Haddock", "Cod", "Saithe")
final <- idxFinalT(sim0)
lfi0 <- getProportionOfLargeFish(sim0, species = demersal_species,
                                 min_w = 10, max_w = 100e3, 
                                 threshold_l = 40)[[final]]
mw0 <- getMeanWeight(sim0, species = demersal_species,
                     min_w = 10,max_w = 100e3)[[final]]
mmw0 <- getMeanMaxWeight(sim0, species = demersal_species,
                         min_w = 10, max_w = 100e3)[final, "mmw_biomass"]
slope0 <- getCommunitySlope(sim0, species = demersal_species,
                            min_w = 10, max_w = 100e3)[final, "slope"]
```

We also calculate the time series of these indicators for the exploited
community:
```{r label=ns_comm_indicators}
lfi <- getProportionOfLargeFish(sim, species = demersal_species,
                                min_w = 10, max_w = 100e3, 
                                threshold_l = 40)
mw <- getMeanWeight(sim, species = demersal_species,
                    min_w = 10, max_w = 100e3)
mmw <- getMeanMaxWeight(sim, species = demersal_species, min_w = 10,
                        max_w = 100e3)[, "mmw_biomass"]
slope <- getCommunitySlope(sim, species = demersal_species, min_w = 10,
                           max_w = 100e3)[, "slope"]
```

We can plot the exploited and unexploited indicators, along LFI reference level.
Here we do it using `ggplot2` which uses data.frames. We make three data.frames
(one for the time series, one for the unexploited levels and one for the
reference level): Each data.frame is a data.frame of each of the measures,
stacked on top of each other.
```{r label=plot_ns_indicators, fig.cap="Historical (solid) and unexploited (dashed) and reference (dotted) community indicators for the North Sea multispecies model."}
library(ggplot2)
years <- 1967:2010
# Simulated data
community_plot_data <- rbind(
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "LFI", data = lfi),
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "Mean Weight", data = mw),
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "Mean Max Weight", data = mmw),
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "Slope", data = slope))
# Unexploited data
community_unfished_data <- rbind(
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "LFI", data = lfi0),
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "Mean Weight", data = mw0),
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "Mean Max Weight", data = mmw0),
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "Slope", data = slope0))
# Reference level
community_reference_level <-
    data.frame(year = years, measure = "LFI", data = lfi0 * 0.8)
# Build up the plot
ggplot(community_plot_data) + 
    geom_line(aes(x = year, y = data)) +
    facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free") + 
    geom_line(aes(x = year, y = data), linetype = "dashed",
              data = community_unfished_data) +
    geom_line(aes(x=year,y=data), linetype = "dotted",
              data = community_reference_level)
```

According to our simulations, historically the LFI in the North Sea has been below the reference level.


## Future projections

As well as investigating the historical simulations, we can run projections into the future.
Here we run two projections to 2050 with different fishing scenarios.

* Continue fishing at 2010 levels (the status quo scenario).
* From 2010 to 2015 linearly change the fishing mortality to approach $F_{MSY}$ and then continue at $F_{MSY}$ until 2050.

Rather than looking at community indicators here, we will calculate the SSB of each species in the model and compare the projected levels to a biodiversity target based on the reference point $0.1 SSB_{F=0}.$ 

Before we can run the simulations, we need to set up arrays of future effort.
We will continue to use effort relative to the level in 1990.
Here we build on our existing array of relative effort to make an array for the first scenario. Note the use of the `t()` command to transpose the array. This is needed because R recycles by rows, so we need to build the array with the dimensions rotated to start with.
We make an array of the future effort, and then bind it underneath the `relative_effort` array used in the previous section.

```{r label = ns_scenario1_relative_effort}
scenario1 <- t(array(relative_effort["2010", ], dim = c(12, 40),
    dimnames = list(NULL, year = 2011:2050)))
scenario1 <- rbind(relative_effort, scenario1)
```

The relative effort array for the second scenario is more complicated to make and requires a little bit of R gymnastics
(it might be easier for you to prepare this in a spreadsheet and read it in).
For this one we need values of $F_{MSY}$.  
```{r label = ns_scenario2_relative_effort}
fmsy <- c(Sprat = 0.2, Sandeel = 0.2, N.pout = 0.2, Herring = 0.25, Dab = 0.2,
    Whiting = 0.2, Sole = 0.22, Gurnard = 0.2, Plaice = 0.25, Haddock = 0.3,
    Cod = 0.19, Saithe = 0.3)
scenario2 <- t(array(fmsy, dim = c(12, 40), 
                     dimnames = list(NULL, year = 2011:2050)))
scenario2 <- rbind(relative_effort, scenario2)
for (sp in dimnames(scenario2)[[2]]) {
    scenario2[as.character(2011:2015), sp] <- scenario2["2010", sp] +
        (((scenario2["2015", sp] - scenario2["2010", sp]) / 5) * 1:5)
}
```

We are now ready to project the two scenarios.
```{r label = project_ns_future_scenarios}
sim1 <- project(params, effort = scenario1, dt = 0.25)
sim2 <- project(params, effort = scenario2, dt = 0.25)
```

We can now compare the projected SSB values in both scenarios to the biodiversity reference points.
First we calculate the biodiversity reference points (from the final time step in the unexploited `sim0` simulation):
```{r label=ns_biodiv_ref_point}
ssb0 <- getSSB(sim0)[final, ]
```


Now we build a data.frame of the projected SSB for each species.
We make use of the `melt()` function to transform arrays into data frames.
```{r label=projected_ssb_ns, fig.cap="Historical and projected SSB under two fishing scenarios. Status quo (red), Fmsy (yellow). Unexploited (blue) and reference levels (purple) are also shown."}
years <- 1967:2050
ssb1_df <- melt(getSSB(sim1))
ssb2_df <- melt(getSSB(sim2))
ssb_df <- rbind(
    cbind(ssb1_df, scenario = "Status quo"),
    cbind(ssb2_df, scenario = "Fmsy"))
ssb_unexploited_df <- cbind(expand.grid(
    sp = names(ssb0),
    time = 1967:2050),
    value = as.numeric(ssb0),
    scenario = "Unexploited")
ssb_reference_df <- cbind(expand.grid(
    sp = names(ssb0),
    time = 1967:2050),
    value = as.numeric(ssb0 * 0.1),
    scenario = "Reference")
ssb_all_df <- rbind(ssb_df, ssb_unexploited_df, ssb_reference_df)
colours <- c("Status quo" = "red", "Fmsy" = "yellow",
             "Unexploited" = "blue", "Reference" = "purple")
ggplot(ssb_all_df) +
    geom_line(aes(x = time, y = value, colour = scenario)) +
    facet_wrap(~sp, scales = "free", nrow = 4) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    scale_colour_manual(values = colours)
```

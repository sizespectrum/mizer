We use this principle and a size-based equilibrium model where asymptotic length is used as a functional trait to investigate how natural mortality should scale with size within and across pelagic and demersal species of North Sea teleosts. The model predicts natural mortality to scale with body length raised to a power of −1.66 at current levels of exploitation. Additionally, natural mortality of demersal species should be proportional to asymptotic length raised to a power of 0.80, so generating a higher natural mortality at a given length for large species than for small ones. The model also suggests that the exponent in the scaling of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter K with asymptotic length should be more negative for pelagic than for demersal species. We test our results by analysing independent estimates of predation mortality, the scaling of maximum recruitment per unit of spawning-stock biomass with asymptotic length, and the general relationship between K and asymptotic length for demersal and pelagic families of fish. All tests are consistent with our modelling results.},

Whereas unexploited reference points provide a baseline for assessing the relative magnitude of fishing impacts, target or limit reference points are needed to guide management. Values for target or limit reference points are difficult to justify on scientific grounds. However, given that fishing impacts in most ecosystems need to be reduced to meet the objectives of the {EAFM}, we argue that reference directions provide alternative medium-term management targets. We show that the power of surveys to detect trends consistent with reference directions depends on the range of body size classes included in the analysis. Selection of different size ranges will weight metrics to respond to the release of small fish from predation, the depletion of larger individuals as a consequence of exploitation, or both. Such weightings may not be consistent over time, because the differential vulnerability of larger species, within-population changes, predator–prey relationships, and the effects of competition depend on contemporary rates of fishing mortality and the history of exploitation. The power of the surveys investigated is poor on time scales of less than 5–10 years. Therefore, size-based indicators provide better support for medium-term, rather than year-on-year, management decision making.},

The {FLR} framework (Fisheries Library for R) is a development effort directed towards the evaluation of fisheries management strategies. The overall goal is to develop a common framework to facilitate collaboration within and across disciplines (e.g. biological, ecological, statistical, mathematical, economic, and social) and, in particular, to ensure that new modelling methods and software are more easily validated and evaluated, as well as becoming widely available once developed. Specifically, the framework details how to implement and link a variety of fishery, biological, and economic software packages so that alternative management strategies and procedures can be evaluated for their robustness to uncertainty before implementation. The design of the framework, including the adoption of object-orientated programming, its feasibility to be extended to new processes, and its application to new management approaches (e.g. ecosystem affects of fishing), is discussed. The importance of open source for promoting transparency and allowing technology transfer between disciplines and researchers is stressed.},

	abstract = {1. Elasticity and sensitivity analyses are used widely in evolutionary   biology, ecology and population management. However, almost all   applications ignore density dependence, despite the widespread   assumption that density dependence is ubiquitous. We assess whether this   matters by comparing density-dependent and density-independent   elasticity analyses for the {LPA} model of Tribolium.   2. Density-independent elasticities of lambda are a poor indicator of   the effects of changes in demographic parameters on population size,   even for populations at stable equilibrium. With non-equilibrium   dynamics, the divergence can be particularly large. In the extreme, a   change in a demographic parameter with a positive effect on individual   fitness can reduce mean population size, so even the sign of a   density-independent elasticity may be wrong. Elasticities of larval,   pupal and adult numbers are not proportional to each other, neither are   they proportional to elasticities of total population size.   3. A full density-dependent analysis is therefore vital when concerned   with effects on population numbers, as in population management, pest   control and prediction of population effects of toxins.   4. When examining the consequences for individual fitness of changes in   demographic parameters, density-independent elasticities provide a more   useful approximation to the density-dependent values. However, they fail   to detect cases where non-equilibrium dynamics means that particular   life histories gain an advantage by exploiting predictable periods when   density dependence is relaxed.   5. This phenomenon can produce a marked change in the pattern of   elasticities as a bifurcation is crossed. The corresponding changes in   selection pressures may act to stabilize dynamics in some circumstances   and destabilize them in others. There is no single answer to the   question of whether selection should favour equilibrium or   non-equilibrium dynamics.},

They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most {SBIs} can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single {SBI} can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of {SBI} should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of {SBIs} and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5–10 years) strategic management in {EAF} should facilitate their use.},

	abstract = {1. Large-bodied species are especially vulnerable to fishing in mixed   fisheries. Their effective conservation requires predictions of   sensitivity and exposure to fishing mortality, but such predictions are   hard to make when the population dynamics of most of these species have   not been described.   2. We present a method for assessing sensitivity and conservation   management reference points using widely available life-history data.   The method allows the sensitivity of all fish species in a community to   be assessed in relation to conservation-and yield-based fishery   reference points.   3. Knowledge of sensitivity is used to (i) rank species by sensitivity,   (ii) conduct a risk assessment to identify species potentially   vulnerable to current fishing pressure and (iii) examine potential   tradeoffs between fishery catches and the conservation status of   sensitive species.   4. The method is applied to the Celtic Sea bottom-dwelling fish   community. For the species present, conservation threshold fishing   mortalities ranged from 0 05 per year for the most sensitive large   elasmobranchs to over 1 per year for small teleosts. The assessment   predicts that current levels of fishing mortality may place all the   elasmobranchs and over a quarter of the teleosts below conservation   reference points.   5. Depending on the relative mortality rates affecting commercially   targeted species and species of conservation concern, up to 65\% of the   potential yield-per-recruit of commercially important species may have   to be forgone to reduce fishing mortality below conservation limit   reference points for the most sensitive species.   6. Synthesis and applications. The method presented provides a clear   objective procedure to construct ranked species sensitivity lists that   can inform management, monitoring and research. The Celtic Sea case   study demonstrated that limiting fishing pressure on key commercial   stocks to meet fisheries production targets may be insufficient to   guarantee the persistence of more sensitive species. Management actions   that effectively decouple the mortality rates on commercial species and   ` conservation' species are likely to be required to make progress in   relation to conservation objectives. The method would support rapid   assessment of sensitivity to fishing in many regions around the world as   only taxonomic lists and estimates of body size are required.},

Fishing and environment drive spatial heterogeneity in Celtic Sea fish community size structure. – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsr137. The Large Fish Indicator ({LFI)} is a univariate size-based indicator of fish community state that has been selected to support the {OSPAR} fish community Ecological Quality Objective ({EcoQO).} To operate this {EcoQO}, a survey-based {LFI} for each {OSPAR} region needs to be developed. However, fish communities in these regions are spatially heterogeneous, and there is evidence of within-region spatial variation in the {LFI} that could confound an overall indicator series. For Celtic Sea trawl-survey sites, spline correlograms indicate positive spatial autocorrelation at a similar range (∼40 km) for the {LFI} and for fishing effort (h year−1) from vessel monitoring systems. Statistical models reveal a strong negative effect on annual {LFI} by site of fishing effort within a radius of 40 km. There was a weak effect of fishing within 20 km and no effect at 10 km. {LFI} also varied significantly with substratum and with local fish community composition identified by a resemblance matrix derived from the survey data. Finally, there was a weak effect of survey year on {LFI.} Spatial stratification of {LFI} calculations may be necessary when developing size-based indicators for {OSPAR} or Marine Strategy Framework Directive regions.},

	abstract = {We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on 1) biomass distribution as a function of individual size, 2) biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and 3) relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation.},

This assumption   has important implications for size-based fish population models and for   predicting the outcome of size-dependent fisheries management measures   such as mesh-size regulations. To test the assumption, we critically   review the empirical estimates of the natural mortality, M (year(-1)),   of marine and brackish water fish stocks and model them as a function of   von Bertalanffy growth parameters, L(infinity) (cm) and K (year(-1)),   temperature (Kelvin) and length, L (cm). Using the Arrhenius equation to   describe the relationship between M and temperature, we find M to be   significantly related to length, L(infinity) and K, but not to   temperature (R(2) = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 168). Temperature and K are   significantly correlated and when K is removed from the model the   temperature term becomes significant, but the resulting model explains   less of the total variance (R(2) = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 168). The   relationships between M, L, L(infinity), K and temperature are shown to   be in general accordance with previous theoretical and empirical   investigations. We conclude that natural mortality is significantly   related to length and growth characteristics and recommend to use the   empirical formula: ln(M) = 0.55) - 1.61ln(L) + 1.44ln(L(infinity)) +   ln(K), for estimating the natural mortality of marine and brackish water   fish.},

Unfortunately, however, no complete empirical dataset exists on the relationship between minimal and maximal metabolism (and thus aerobic scope) for any fish species throughout ontogeny, and thus such an association is hard to delineate. We measured standard and maximal metabolism in three marine fish species over their entire life history, and show that while aerobic scope depends greatly on body size and developmental trajectory, it is extremely small during the early life stages (factorial aerobic scope≤1.5). Our findings strongly suggest that limited scope for aerobic activity early in life is likely to constrain physiological function and ultimately impact behaviour and possibly survival. Furthermore, our results have important implications for ecological models that incorporate metabolic scaling, and provide additional evidence against the existence of ‘universal’ scaling exponents.},

Recently, these relationships have been incorporated into the metabolic theory of ecology ({MTE)} that links the ecology of populations, communities and ecosystems to the {MR} of individual organisms. The fundamental equation of {MTE} derives the relation between mass and {MR} using first principles and predicts the temperature dependence of {MR} based on biochemical kinetics. It is a deliberately simple, zeroth-order approximation that represents a baseline against which variation in real biological systems can be examined. In the present study, we evaluate the fundamental equation of {MTE} against other more parameter-rich models for {MR} using an information-theoretic approach to penalize the inclusion of additional parameters. Using a comparative database of {MR} measurements for 1359 species, from 11 groups ranging from prokaryotes to mammals, and spanning 16 orders of magnitude in mass and a {59°C} range in body temperature, we show that differences between taxa in the mass and temperature dependence of {MR} are sufficiently large as to be retained in the best model for {MR} despite the requirement for estimation of 22 more parameters than the fundamental equation of {MTE.}},

Further, an ecosystem approach to management requires the identification of ecological reference points against which management objectives might be set. In applying indicators, identifying reference points, and setting objectives, an obvious requirement is that the indicators respond primarily to the anthropogenic activity being managed and are sufficiently sensitive that impacts of the activity and the responses to management action are clearly demonstrable. Here we apply a suite of 12 indicators to Scottish August groundfish survey data collected in the northern North Sea over the period 1925–1997. These include indicators of size structure, life-history character composition, species diversity, and trophic structure within the community. Our choice of analytical design has two purposes; first to show that fishing has unequivocally affected these various aspects of the structure of the groundfish community, and second to illustrate an approach by which long time-series data sets might be used to identify possible management reference points. The results are discussed in the context of selecting ecological indicators in support of an ecosystem approach to management and determining appropriate reference points for objective-setting.},

Here   we use a novel size- and trait-based model to explore how marine   ecosystems might react to perturbations from different types of fishing   pressure. The model explicitly resolves the whole life history of fish,   from larvae to adults. The results show that fishing does not change the   overall slope of the size spectrum, but depletes the largest individuals   and induces trophic cascades. A trophic cascade can propagate both up   and down in trophic levels driven by a combination of changes in   predation mortality and food limitation. The cascade is damped as it   comes further away from the perturbed trophic level. Fishing on several   trophic levels leads to a disappearance of the signature of the trophic   cascade.

	abstract = {* {1Widely} observed macro-ecological patterns in log abundance vs. log body mass of organisms can be explained by simple scaling theory based on food (energy) availability across a spectrum of body sizes. The theory predicts that when food availability falls with body size (as in most aquatic food webs where larger predators eat smaller prey), the scaling between log N vs. log m is steeper than when organisms of different sizes compete for a shared unstructured resource (e.g. autotrophs, herbivores and detritivores; hereafter dubbed ‘detritivores’). * {2In} real communities, the mix of feeding characteristics gives rise to complex food webs. Such complexities make empirical tests of scaling predictions prone to error if: (i) the data are not disaggregated in accordance with the assumptions of the theory being tested, or (ii) the theory does not account for all of the trophic interactions within and across the communities sampled. * {3We} disaggregated whole community data collected in the North Sea into predator and detritivore components and report slopes of log abundance vs. log body mass relationships. Observed slopes for fish and epifaunal predator communities (–1·2 to –2·25) were significantly steeper than those for infaunal detritivore communities (–0·56 to –0·87). * {4We} present a model describing the dynamics of coupled size spectra, to explain how coupling of predator and detritivore communities affects the scaling of log N vs. log m. The model captures the trophic interactions and recycling of material that occur in many aquatic ecosystems. * {5Our} simulations demonstrate that the biological processes underlying growth and mortality in the two distinct size spectra lead to patterns consistent with data. Slopes of log N vs. log m were steeper and growth rates faster for predators compared to detritivores. Size spectra were truncated when primary production was too low for predators and when detritivores experienced predation pressure. * {6The} approach also allows us to assess the effects of external sources of mortality (e.g. harvesting). Removal of large predators resulted in steeper predator spectra and increases in their prey (small fish and detritivores). The model predictions are remarkably consistent with observed patterns of exploited ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The relationship between previously published values of “the intrinsic rate of natural increase” (r m ) and body weight is studied. When organisms covering a wide range of body weights are compared, a correlation is found which can be described by the equation r m {=aW} n where r m is the intrinsic rate of natural increase per day and W is the average body weight in grams; a is a constant which takes three different values for unicellular organisms and heterotherm and homoiotherm animals respectively. The constant n has a value of about-0.275 for all three groups. This result is compared to the previously found relationship between the metabolic rate per unit weight and body size. It is shown that r m can be inter-preted as the productivity of an exponentially growing population and thus must correlate with metabolic rate. The values of the constants a and n, however, show that for each of the three groups, unicellular organisms, heterotherms and homoiotherms the ratio of energy used for maintenance to that used for production increases with increasing body size and that the evolution from protozoa to metazoa and the evolution from heterotherm to homoiotherm animals in both cases resulted in not only an increased metabolic rate, as shown previously, but also in a decreased population growth efficiency. It is shown that the increase in reproductive potential of homoiotherms relative to that of heterotherms is due to a shorter prereproductive period in the former group. Previous estimates of r m for different species and comparisons between these values in relation to their ecology are discussed in context with the found “r m -body weight” relationship. Attempts to show that such comparisons will be more meaningful when body size is included in the considerations are made. It is suggested that the found relationship may represent the maximum values r m can take rather than average values for all species, since it is likely that the species used for laboratory population-studies are biased in favor of species with high reproductive potentials.},

Improved quantification of these   relationships and their response to the environment is needed to   parameterize food web models and describe food web structure and   function. A compiled data set comprising 29 582 records of individual   prey eaten at 21 locations by individual predators that spanned 10   orders of magnitude in mass and lived in marine environments ranging   from the poles to the tropics was used to investigate the influence of   predator size and environment on predator and prey size relationships.   Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that predator prey mass ratios   ({PPMR)} increased with predator mass. The amount of the increase varied   among locations and predator species and individuals but was not   significantly influenced by temperature. latitude, depth, or primary   production. Increases in {PPMR} with predator mass implied nonlinear   relationships between log body mass and trophic level and reductions in   transfer efficiency with increasing body size. The results suggest that   very general rules determine dominant trends in {PPMR} in diverse marine   ecosystems, leading to the ubiquity of size-based trophic Structuring   and the consistency of observed relationships between the relative   abundance of individuals and their body size.},

Model and parametric uncertainty is jointly characterised and the challenge of addressing model selection when the model itself is part of the hierarchy is addressed using the deviance information criterion ({DIC)} and posterior predictive analysis. For the six herring stocks the across-stock posterior evidence in favour of over-compensatory dynamics is fairly strong, with the Ricker and Shepherd models performing the best across the model-selection criteria. For a specific model form we perform a 20 year retrospective analysis (hierarchical and non-hierarchical) to see how temporal information flow occurs in a hierarchical framework, how this can improve our estimates of key parameters, and how this might influence management paradigms (such as Maximum Sustainable Yield) that are based on such estimates.},

	abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of natural communities is the variation in size that can be observed between organisms, a variation that to a substantial degree is intraspecific. Size variation within species by necessity implies that ecological interactions vary both in intensity and type over the life cycle of an individual. Physiologically structured population models ({PSPMs)} constitute a modelling approach especially designed to analyse these size-dependent interactions as they explicitly link individual level processes such as consumption and growth to population dynamics. We discuss two cases where {PSPMs} have been used to analyse the dynamics of size-structured populations. In the first case, a model of a size-structured consumer population feeding on a non-structured prey was successful in predicting both qualitative (mechanisms) and quantitative (individual growth, survival, cycle amplitude) aspects of the population dynamics of a planktivorous fish population. We conclude that single generation cycles as a result of intercohort competition is a general outcome of size-structured consumer–resource interactions. In the second case, involving both cohort competition and cannibalism, we show that {PSPMs} may predict double asymptotic growth trajectories with individuals ending up as giants. These growth trajectories, which have also been observed in field data, could not be predicted from individual level information, but are emergent properties of the population feedback on individual processes. In contrast to the size-structured consumer–resource model, the dynamics in this case cannot be reduced to simpler lumped stage-based models, but can only be analysed within the domain of {PSPMs.} Parameter values used in {PSPMs} adhere to the individual level and are derived independently from the system at focus, whereas model predictions involve both population level processes and individual level processes under conditions of population feedback. This leads to an increased ability to test model predictions but also to a larger set of variables that is predicted at both the individual and population level. The results turn out to be relatively robust to specific model assumptions and thus render a higher degree of generality than purely individual-based models. At the same time, {PSPMs} offer a much higher degree of realism, precision and testing ability than lumped stage-based or non-structured models. The results of our analyses so far suggest that also in more complex species configurations only a limited set of mechanisms determines the dynamics of {PSPMs.} We therefore conclude that there is a high potential for developing an individual-based, size-dependent community theory using {PSPMs.}},

The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic   growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving   the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each   species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all   model parameters are made species independent through scaling with   individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are   determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as   life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be   reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated   and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of   organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and   individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that   the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution   provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web   simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on   biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass   distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between   predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model   additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size   at maturation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To produce a protocol for use when developing regional {LFIs}, the North Sea experience is interpreted using data from the Celtic Sea. Differences in fish community species composition and size distribution were reflected in a different species complex and large fish threshold (50 cm) for the Celtic Sea {LFI.} However, a lag of 12–14 years in the relationship between assemblage-averaged fishing mortality Fcom,y and the {LFI} suggested similar underlying ecological mechanisms to the North Sea. The indicator responded to changes in small fish biomass that follow fishing-induced changes in the level of predation by large demersal piscivores. The Celtic Sea {LFI} showed maximum observed values {\textgreater}0.40 before 1990, and 0.40 is here proposed as an {EcoQO.} Development of regional {LFIs} demands a flexible process rather than a strictly prescriptive protocol.},

	abstract = {To measure and predict the response of fish communities to exploitation,   it is necessary to understand how the direct and indirect effects of   fishing interact. Because fishing and predation are size-selective   processes, the potential response can be explored with size-based   models. We use a simulation approach to describe the relationship   between size spectrum slope and overall fishing mortality and to try to   understand how a linear spectrum might be maintained. The model uses 15   parameters to describe a 13-"species" fish community, where species are   defined by their maximum body size and the general relationship between   size and life-history characteristics. The simulations allow us to   assess the role of changes in the strength and type of density   dependence in controlling the response to fishing, and to investigate   the trade-off between catches and stock status of the different species.   The outputs showed that the linear slope of the size spectrum was a   function of community exploitation rate. Density-dependent controls,   specifically predation mortality and the extent of compensation in the   stock-recruit relationship, were key mechanisms in maintaining a linear   spectrum. A linear spectrum emerged independent of the rate of   compensation in the stock-recruit relationship. When this rate was low,   the effects of changes in fishing mortality on predator abundance   dominated those on spawning-stock biomass, whereas the dominance was   reversed when the compensation rate in the stock-recruit relationship   was high. The approach allows us to explore the effects of different   fishing mortality schedules on properties of the fish community, to   assess how fishing affects species with different life histories in   mixed fisheries, and to assess the effects of selectively fishing   different size classes. The simulations indicate that the size classes   to be included when developing and interpreting size-based metrics must   be carefully considered in relation to the trophic structure and likely   strength of predatory interactions in the community. Runs with different   fishing mortality by size suggest that the dynamics of predation cannot   compensate fully for changing rates and patterns of exploitation,   implying that the effects of selectively fishing different size classes   should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The intensive exploitation of fish communities often leads to substantial reductions in the abundance of target species, with ramifications for the structure and stability of the ecosystem as a whole. 2. We explored changes in the mean trophic level of the Celtic Sea ({ICES} divisions {VII} f-j) fish community using commercial landings, survey data and estimates of trophic level derived from the analysis of nitrogen stable isotopes. 3. Our analyses showed that there has been a significant decline in the mean trophic level of survey catches from 1982 to 2000 and a decline in the trophic level of landings from 1946 to 1998. 4. The decline in mean trophic level through time resulted from a reduction in the abundance of large piscivorous fishes and an increase in smaller pelagic species which feed at a lower trophic level. 5. Similar patterns of decline in the trophic level of both catches and landings imply that there have been substantial changes in the underlying structure of the Celtic Sea fish community and not simply a change in fishery preferences. 6. We suggest that the reported changes in trophic structure result from reductions in the spawning stock biomass of traditional target species associated with intensive fishing, together with long-term climate variability. 7. The relative distribution of fish market prices has changed significantly over the past 22 years, with high trophic level species experiencing greater price rises than lower trophic level species. 8. Although decreased abundance of high trophic level species will ultimately have negative economic consequences, the reduction in mean trophic level of the fish community as a whole may allow the system to sustain higher fishery yields. 9.

Size-based community metrics are potentially useful indicators because of their theoretical foundation and practical utility. Temporal and spatial patterns in size-based community metrics for Celtic Sea fish are described and calculated using data from the English groundfish survey of the area (1987–2003). The results reveal that the size structure of the community has changed over time, and that a decrease in the relative abundance of larger fish was accompanied by an increase in smaller fish (4–25 g). Temporal analyses of the effects of fishing and climate variation suggest that fishing generally has had a stronger effect on size structure than changes in temperature. Therefore, size-based metrics respond clearly to the effects of fishing even in variable environments, reflecting the ubiquity of size-based processes in defining community structure and responses to mortality. Spatial analyses were inconclusive, probably owing to the limited area for which fishing effort, temperature, and survey data were all available.},

Here we offer an alternative approach to the diversity–stability problem by examining the stability and dynamics of size and trait distributions of individuals. The analysis is performed by comparing the properties of two size spectrum models. The first model considers all individuals as belonging to the same “average” species, i.e., without a description of diversity. The second model introduces diversity by further considering individuals by a trait, here asymptotic body size. The dynamic properties of the models are described by a stability analysis of equilibrium solutions and by the non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the introduction of trait diversity expands the set of parameters for which the equilibrium is stable and, if the community is unstable, makes the oscillations smaller, slower, and more regular. The stabilizing mechanism is the variation in growth rate between individuals with the same body size but different trait values.},

Many fish communities are heavily exploited and rebuilding plans need to be implemented for depleted species. Within an ecosystem approach to management, development of rebuilding plans should include consideration of the expected consequences of the rebuilding of the target species on the rest of the marine community. Using size- and trait-based single-species and community models, a general assessment is made of the direct and indirect ecological consequences of a rebuilding plan based on a reduction in fishing mortality. If fishing mortality is sufficiently reduced, the time-scale of rebuilding is in the order of the time to reach maturation of an individual, and the expected trajectory can be reliably predicted by a single-species model. Indirect effects of increased abundance are a decrease in individuals in the trophic levels above and below the target species. The decrease in biomass of the neighbouring trophic levels is expected to be much smaller than the increase in the target species and to be largest in species on the trophic level above. We discuss which effects could be responsible when a rebuilding plan does not result in the expected increase and how our results could be applied in a practical management situation.},

	abstract = {* {1Widely} observed macro-ecological patterns in log abundance vs. log body mass of organisms can be explained by simple scaling theory based on food (energy) availability across a spectrum of body sizes. The theory predicts that when food availability falls with body size (as in most aquatic food webs where larger predators eat smaller prey), the scaling between log N vs. log m is steeper than when organisms of different sizes compete for a shared unstructured resource (e.g. autotrophs, herbivores and detritivores; hereafter dubbed ‘detritivores’). * {2In} real communities, the mix of feeding characteristics gives rise to complex food webs. Such complexities make empirical tests of scaling predictions prone to error if: (i) the data are not disaggregated in accordance with the assumptions of the theory being tested, or (ii) the theory does not account for all of the trophic interactions within and across the communities sampled. * {3We} disaggregated whole community data collected in the North Sea into predator and detritivore components and report slopes of log abundance vs. log body mass relationships. Observed slopes for fish and epifaunal predator communities (–1·2 to –2·25) were significantly steeper than those for infaunal detritivore communities (–0·56 to –0·87). * {4We} present a model describing the dynamics of coupled size spectra, to explain how coupling of predator and detritivore communities affects the scaling of log N vs. log m. The model captures the trophic interactions and recycling of material that occur in many aquatic ecosystems. * {5Our} simulations demonstrate that the biological processes underlying growth and mortality in the two distinct size spectra lead to patterns consistent with data. Slopes of log N vs. log m were steeper and growth rates faster for predators compared to detritivores. Size spectra were truncated when primary production was too low for predators and when detritivores experienced predation pressure. * {6The} approach also allows us to assess the effects of external sources of mortality (e.g. harvesting). Removal of large predators resulted in steeper predator spectra and increases in their prey (small fish and detritivores). The model predictions are remarkably consistent with observed patterns of exploited ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In aquatic ecosystems, where organisms typically feed and grow by eating smaller individuals, a characteristic size spectrum emerges, such that large organisms are much more rare than small ones. Here, a stochastic individual-based model for the dynamics of size spectra is described, based on birth, growth, and death of individuals, using simple assumptions about feeding behavior. It is shown that the deterministic limit derived from the stochastic process is a partial differential equation previously used to describe the dynamics of size spectra. The equation has two classes of dynamics in the long term. The first is a steady state. A derivation under simple mass-balance assumptions shows that, at steady state, the linear size spectrum relating log abundance to log mass has a slope of approximately −1, similar to that often observed in natural size spectra. The second class of dynamics, not previously described, is a traveling-wave solution in which waves move along the size spectrum from small to large body size. Traveling waves become more likely when predators prefer prey much smaller than themselves and when they are specialized in the range of prey body sizes consumed. Wavelength depends on the size of prey relative to the size of predator, and wave speed depends on how fast mass moves through the spectrum.},

	abstract = {Indicators are needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries ({EAF)}, by providing information on the state of the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an {EAF.} Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an {EAF} will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an original size-structured mathematical model of the energy flow through marine ecosystems, based on established ecological and physiological processes and mass conservation principles. The model is based on a nonlocal partial differential equation which represents the transfer of energy in both time and body weight (size) in marine ecosystems. The processes taken into account include size-based opportunistic trophic interactions, competition for food, allocation of energy between growth and reproduction, somatic and maturity maintenance, predatory and starvation mortality. All the physiological rates are temperature-dependent. The physiological bases of the model are derived from the dynamic energy budget theory. The model outputs the dynamic size-spectrum of marine ecosystems in term of energy content per weight class as well as many other size-dependent diagnostic variables such as growth rate, egg production or predation mortality. In stable environmental conditions and using a reference set of parameters derived from empirical studies, the model converges toward a stationary linear log–log size-spectrum with a slope equal to −1.06, which is consistent with the values reported in empirical studies. In some cases, the distribution of the largest sizes departs from the stationary linear solution and is slightly curved downward. A sensitivity analysis to the parameters is conducted systematically. It shows that the stationary size-spectrum is not very sensitive to the parameters of the model. Numerical simulations of the effects of temperature and primary production variability on marine ecosystems size-spectra are provided in a companion paper [Maury, O., Shin, Y.-J., Faugeras, B., Ben Ari, T., Marsac, F., 2007.

	abstract = {It is generally recognized that larger animals eat more, live longer, have larger offspring, and so on; but it is unusual to see these commonplace observations as a basis for scientific biology. A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions. It will interest advanced students of ecology and comparative physiology as well as professional biologists.},

Using a   length-based multi-species model, we investigate the effects of   selective versus nonselective fishing on fish communities. Both size and   species selectivity are examined, and fishing effects on biodiversity   are measured with three indices: (i) evenness, (ii) the number of   collapsed species, and (iii) an index of size diversity. The model is   parameterized for the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities. The   results suggest that there is no "optimal" size selectivity to maintain   biodiversity: the effects of each exploitation pattern depend on the   selectivity of the gear (i. e., the shape of the selection curve)   relative to the available sizes. Catching a narrow range of species   almost always reduced evenness and species richness more than taking the   same catch from a broader range of species. In summary, neither   selective nor nonselective fishing can be said to be generally   preferable for conserving biodiversity; the outcome depends on the   particular species composition and size structure of the community.   Advice intended to inform management will need to be based on clear   definitions of biodiversity, and unambiguous management objectives for   biodiversity and the fishery.},

Trend analysis of indicators: a comparison of recent changes in the status of marine ecosystems around the world. – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 67: 000–000. Time-series of ecological and exploitation indicators collected from 19 ecosystems were analysed to investigate whether there have been temporal trends in the status of fish communities. Using linear and non-linear statistical methods, trends are reported for six indicators (mean length of fish in the community, mean lifespan, proportion of predatory fish, total biomass of surveyed species, mean trophic level of landings, and inverse fishing pressure), and the redundancy of these indicators across ecosystems is evaluated. The expected direction of change for an ecosystem that is increasingly impacted by fishing is a decline in all indicators. A mixture of negative and positive directions of change is recorded, both within and among all ecosystems considered. No consistent patterns in the redundancy of the ecological indicators across ecosystems emerged from the analyses, confirming that each indicator provided complementary information on ecosystem status. The different trends in indicators may reflect differing historical exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in these systems. Commitment to monitoring programmes and development of system-specific baseline, target, and threshold reference levels are required. Improved understanding of the responsiveness and performance of ecological indicators to management actions are needed to address adequately whether ecosystems are recovering from, or being further impacted by, fishing, and whether management targets are being met. The relative effects of multiple environmental and ecological processes as well as multiple human-induced stressors that characterize exploited ecosystems also need to be quantified.},

Fishing alters community size structure by selectively removing larger individual fish and by changing the relative abundance of different-sized species. To assess the relative importance of individual- and species-level effects, two indices of fish community structure were compared, the relative abundance of large fish individuals (large fish indicator, {LFI)} and the relative abundance of large fish species (large species indicator, {LSI).} The two indices were strongly correlated for empirical data from the Celtic Sea and for data from simulated model communities, suggesting that much of the variability in the {LFI} is caused by shifts in the relative abundance of species ({LSI).} This correlation is explained by the observation that most of the biomass of a given species is spread over few length classes, a range spanning the factor 2 of individual length, such that most species contributed predominantly to either the small or the large component of the {LFI.} The results suggest that the effects of size-selective fishing in the Celtic Sea are mediated mainly through changes in community composition.},

We use all available age-structured stock assessments to evaluate the adult biomass trajectories and exploitation status of 26 populations of tunas and their relatives (17 tunas, 5 mackerels, and 4 Spanish mackerels) from 1954 to 2006. Overall, populations have declined, on average, by 60\% over the past half century, but the decline in the total adult biomass is lower (52\%), driven by a few abundant populations. The trajectories of individual populations depend on the interaction between life histories, ecology, and fishing pressure. The steepest declines are exhibited by two distinct groups: the largest, longest lived, highest value temperate tunas and the smaller, short-lived mackerels, both with most of their populations being overexploited. The remaining populations, mostly tropical tunas, have been fished down to approximately maximum sustainable yield levels, preventing further expansion of catches in these fisheries. Fishing mortality has increased steadily to the point where around 12.5\% of the tunas and their relatives are caught each year globally. Overcapacity of these fisheries is jeopardizing their long-term sustainability. To guarantee higher catches, stabilize profits, and reduce collateral impacts on marine ecosystems requires the rebuilding of overexploited populations and stricter management measures to reduce overcapacity and regulate threatening trade.},

	abstract = {The reproductive strategy of most fishes is to produce a large number of tiny eggs, leading to a huge difference between egg size and asymptotic body size. The viability of this strategy is examined by calculating the life-time reproductive success R 0 as a function of the asymptotic body size. A simple criterion for the optimality of producing small eggs is found, depending on the rate of predation relative to the specific rate of consumption. Secondly it is shown that the success of the reproductive strategy is increasing with asymptotic body size. Finally the existence of both upper and lower limits on the allowed asymptotic sizes is demonstrated. A metabolic upper limit to asymptotic body size for all higher animals is derived.},

	title = {Comparison and utility of different size-based metrics of fish communities for detecting fishery impacts},
	volume = {63},
	abstract = {The use of fish community indicators based on size spectra has become popular in the development of an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Size spectrum theory arose from basic ecological work on energy flow, predator–prey interactions, and biomass standing stock and was later applied to fish communities as length–frequency analysis. A multitude of size spectrum indicators have resulted, but it is not clear if they all present similar information. Here we develop a simple framework describing what four size spectra indicators suggest about fish communities, their likely response to fisheries exploitation, their ecological interpretation, and some of their biases. We examined indicators for scientific survey data from six exploited North Atlantic fish communities for the information that they reveal about each community. Each indicator revealed different information and had different biases. Combining indicators for the most impacted system (owing to fisheries and environmental change), the eastern Scotian Shelf, revealed a pattern analogous to Holling's ecological cycle of exploitation, conservation, release, and reorganisation. If this analogy is generally valid, then it suggests that collapsed fish communities are more susceptible to chance events, and recovery is not directly reversible and may not be recoverable (to previous known state) at all if the system moves to an alternative {cycle.Les} indicateurs des communautés de poissons basés sur les spectres de taille servent souvent à donner une approche écosystémique aux études halieutiques. La théorie des spectres de taille s'est développée à partir d'études écologiques fondamentales sur les flux d'énergie, les interactions prédateurs–proies et la biomasse des stocks et elle a été appliquée subséquemment aux communautés de poissons sous la forme d'analyses de fréquence des longueurs. Un grand nombre d'indicateurs du spectre de taille ont été proposés, mais il n'est pas clair qu'ils présentent des informations équivalentes. Nous mettons au point un cadre de travail simple pour décrire ce que quatre indicateurs du spectre de taille révèlent au sujet des communautés de poissons et leur réaction probable à l'exploitation par la pêche; nous présentons aussi l'interprétation écologique et certaines des déformations de ces indicateurs. Nous avons évalué les indicateurs à l'aide de données d'inventaire provenant de six peuplements exploités de poissons de {l'Atlantique} Nord et déterminé l'information qu'ils dévoilent sur chacun des peuplements. Chaque indicateur révèle des informations différentes et présente des déformations particulières. La combinaison des indicateurs pour le système le plus affecté (par les pêches et le changement climatique), soit l'est de la plate-forme néo-écossaise, présente un patron analogue au cycle écologique de Holling, d'exploitation, de conservation, de libération et de réorganisation. Si cette analogie est en gros valide, elle indique que les peuplements effondrés de poissons sont plus vulnérables aux événements aléatoires, que la récupération n'est pas directement réversible et qu'il peut ne pas y avoir de récupération du tout (retour à l'état observé antérieurement) si le système entreprend un cycle de rechange.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

<p>On this page we present the details of the mizer model, taking care to separate the essential features of the model that are hard-coded and the various possible specialisations for which mizer provides setup functions. We will provide links to the functions that can be used to set or change the various model parameters (all collected together in <code><a href="../reference/setParams.html">setParams()</a></code>) as well as to the functions that calculate the various ecological rates in the model (all collected together in <code><a href="../reference/mizerRates.html">mizerRates()</a></code>) because the help pages of these functions will provide useful additional details.</p>
We will not go into detail of how this model is realised in code. Such detail will be provided in the <a href="developer_vignette.html">developer guide</a>. However some details are hidden on this page and you can see them by clicking on links like the following:

<p>The model assumes that, to a first approximation, an individual can be characterized by its weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and its species number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> only. The aim of the model is to calculate the size spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>, which is the <em>density</em> of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\int_w^{w+dw}N_i(w)dw\)</span> is the <em>number</em> of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the size interval <span class="math inline">\([w,w+dw]\)</span>. In other words: the number of individuals in a size range is the area under the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>.</p>
<details><p>Here is a plot of an example size spectrum for two species with <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> on the vertical axis for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> on the horizontal axis.</p>

<p><img src="model_description_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="700"></p>
<p>To represent this continuous size spectrum in the computer, the size variable <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is discretized into a vector <code>w</code> of discrete weights, providing a grid of sizes spanning the range from the smallest egg size to the largest asymptotic size. These grid values divide the full size range into a finite number of size bins. The size bins should be chosen small enough to avoid the discretisation errors from becoming too big. You can fetch this vector with <code><a href="../reference/w.html">w()</a></code> and the vector of bin sizes with <code><a href="../reference/w.html">dw()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The weight grid is set up to be logarithmically spaced, so that <code>w[j]=w[1]*exp(j*dx)</code> for some fixed <code>dx</code>. This grid is set up automatically when creating a MizerParams object.</p>
<p>In the code the size spectrum is stored as an array <code>N</code> such that <code>N[i, a]</code> holds the density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w_a)\)</span> at weights <span class="math inline">\(w_a=\)</span><code>w[a]</code>, or, if time dependence is included, an array such that <code>N[i, a, u]</code> holds <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w_a,t_u)\)</span>. See <code><a href="../reference/N.html">N()</a></code>.</p>
<p>Note that, contrary to what one might have expected, <code>N[i, a]</code> is not the <em>number</em> of individuals in a size bin but the <em>density</em> at a grid point. The number of individuals in the size bin between <code>w[a]</code> and <code>w[a+1]=w[a]+dw[a]</code> is only approximately given as <code>N[i, a]*dw[a]</code>, where <code>dw[a]= w[a+1]-w[a]</code>.</p>

<div id="traffic-on-the-road-to-adulthood" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#traffic-on-the-road-to-adulthood" class="anchor"></a>Traffic on the road to adulthood</h2>
<p>A good way to think about the time evolution of the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> is to consider the familiar situation of traffic density on the roads. A fish’s life is a journey along the size axis from egg size to size at death. There are many other fish making the same journey. The speed with which the fish move along the size axis is their growth rate. This is quite analogous to the speed of traffic on a road. Just as the speed of cars depends on the density of other cars on the road, the growth rate of fish depends on the density of other fish. When the density of cars on a stretch of road is high, their speed decreases, and this leads to a pile-up and can lead to traffic jams. Similarly when the density of fish in a size interval is high, their growth rate goes down due to competition for the same food sources, and this too can lead to pile-ups and bottlenecks. So one just has to replace the space variable in a traffic model by size to get an equation for the fish size spectra.</p>
<p>The additional feature in the evolution of fish densities that is not present in road traffic density is that fish can die while they are growing up, and this death rate is also dependent on the density of other fish.</p>
<p>The time evolution of the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> is described by the McKendrick-von Foerster equation, which is a transport equation (as one would use for traffic density) but with an additional loss term due to fish mortality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w) N_i(w)}{\partial w} 
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w),
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where individual growth <span class="math inline">\(g_i(w)\)</span> and mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> will be described below. There is no need for you to understand the mathematical notation used in this equation to understand its origin: it just says that the rate at which the number of fish in a size bracket changes is the rate at which fish grow into the size bracket from a smaller size minus the rate at which fish grow out of it to a larger size minus the rate at which the fish in the size bracket die. So to simulate the size spectrum dynamics we need to specify the growth rates and the mortality rates. This we will do below. The important point is that these rates depend on the density of other fish of other sizes, making the size-spectrum dynamics non-linear and non-local in very interesting ways. The resulting effects are too complicated to disentangle by pure thought. This is where simulations with the mizer package come in.</p>
<p>This McKendrick-von Foerster equation is approximated in mizer by a finite-difference method. This allows the <code><a href="../reference/project.html">project()</a></code> function in mizer to project the size spectrum forwards in time: Given the spectrum at one time the <code><a href="../reference/project.html">project()</a></code> function calculates it at a set of later times.</p>
<p>Of course there also needs to be reproduction into the smallest size class, otherwise there would be no small fish any more after a while. So for the smallest size class instead of a rate of growth into the size class there is a rate of reproduction of new individuals into that size class. This reproduction will be described further below.</p>
</div>
<div id="resource-density" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#resource-density" class="anchor"></a>Resource density</h2>
<p>Besides the fish spectrum there is also a resource spectrum <span class="math inline">\(NResource(w)\)</span>, representing for example the phytoplankton. This spectrum starts at a smaller size than the fish spectrum, in order to provide food also for the smallest individuals (larvae) of the fish spectrum. By default the time evolution of the resource spectrum is described by a semi-chemostat equation.</p>
<details><p>The semichemostat dynamics are given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nb}
  \frac{\partial N_p(w,t)}{\partial t} 
  = r_p(w) \Big[ c_p (w) - N_p(w,t) \Big] - \mu_p(w) N_p(w,t).
\end{equation}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(r_p(w)\)</span> is the resource regeneration rate and <span class="math inline">\(c_p(w)\)</span> is the carrying capacity in the absence of predation. These parameters are changed with <code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">setResource()</a></code>. By default mizer assumes allometric forms <span class="math display">\[r_p(w)= r_p\, w^{n-1}.\]</span> <span class="math display">\[c_p(w)=\kappa\, w^{-\lambda}.\]</span> You can retrieve these with <code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">getResourceRate()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">getResourceCapacity()</a></code> respectively. It is also possible to implement other resource dynamics, as described in the help page for <code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">setResource()</a></code>. The mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_p(w)\)</span> is due to predation by consumers and is described in the subsection <a href="#resource-mortality">Resource mortality</a>.</p>
<p>Because the resource spectrum spans a different range of sizes these sizes are discretized into a different vector of weights <code>w_full</code>. The last entries of <code>w_full</code> have to coincide with the entries of <code>w</code>. The function <code><a href="../reference/w.html">w_full()</a></code> gives the vector of sizes and <code><a href="../reference/w.html">dw_full()</a></code> gives the vector of bin sizes.</p>
<p>The resource spectrum is then represented by a vector <code>NResource</code> such that <code>NResource[c]</code> =<span class="math inline">\(N_p(\)</span><code>w_full[c]</code><span class="math inline">\()\)</span>.</p>

<div id="growth" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#growth" class="anchor"></a>Growth</h1>
<p>Consumers can grow only by consuming prey. In the next few subsections we will build towards determining the growth rate resulting from predation. We will discuss how we model the predator-prey encounter rate, the resulting rate of consumption, the rate of loss due to metabolism, and the partitioning of the remaining energy into reproduction and growth.</p>
<div id="sec:pref" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#sec:pref" class="anchor"></a>Predator-prey encounter rate</h2>
<p>The rate at which a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> encounters food (mass per time) is determined by summing over all prey species and the resource spectrum and integrating over all prey sizes <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span>, weighted by the selectivity factors: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{i}(w) = \gamma_i(w) \int \left(\sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) +
   \theta_{ip} N_R(w_p) + \right) 
  \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p \, dw_p.
\end{equation}\]</span> This is calculated by <code><a href="../reference/getEncounter.html">getEncounter()</a></code>. The overall prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w)\)</span> sets the predation power of the predator. It could be interpreted as a search volume. It is set by <code><a href="../reference/setSearchVolume.html">setSearchVolume()</a></code>. By default it is assumed to scale allometrically as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w) = \gamma_i\, w^q.\)</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> matrix sets the interaction strength between predators and the various prey species and resource. It is changed with <code><a href="../reference/setInteraction.html">setInteraction()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The size selectivity is encoded in the predation kernel <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i(w,w_p)\)</span>. This is changed with <code><a href="../reference/setPredKernel.html">setPredKernel()</a></code>.</p>
<details><p>An important simplification occurs when the predation kernel <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i(w,w_p)\)</span> depends on the size of the prey <strong>only</strong> through the predator/prey size ratio <span class="math inline">\(w_p/w\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\phi_i(w, w_p)=\tilde{\phi}_i(w/w_p).\]</span> This is assumed by default but can be overruled. The default for the predation kernel is the truncated log-normal function <span class="math display">\[
  \label{eq:4}
  \tilde{\phi}_i(x) = \begin{cases}
  \exp \left[ \dfrac{-(\ln(x / \beta_i))^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right]
  &amp;\text{ if }x\in\left[0,\beta_i\exp(3\sigma_i)\right]\\
  0&amp;\text{ otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> is the preferred predator-prey mass ratio and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i\)</span> sets the width of the predation kernel.</p>
<p>The integral in the expression for the encounter rate is approximated by a Riemann sum over all weight brackets: <span class="math display">\[
{\tt encounter}[i,a] = {\tt search\_vol}[i,a]\sum_{k}
\left( n_{pp}[k] + \sum_{j} \theta[i,j] n[j,k] \right) 
  \phi_i\left(w[a],w[k]\right) w[k]\, dw[k].
\]</span> In the case of a predation kernel that depends on <span class="math inline">\(w/w_p\)</span> only, this becomes a convolution sum and can be evaluated efficiently via fast Fourier transform.</p>
</details>
</div>
<div id="consumption" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#consumption" class="anchor"></a>Consumption</h2>
<p>The encountered food is consumed subjected to a standard Holling functional response type II to represent satiation. This determines the <em>feeding level</em> <span class="math inline">\(f_i(w)\)</span>, which is a dimensionless number between 0 (no food) and 1 (fully satiated) so that <span class="math inline">\(1-f_i(w)\)</span> is the proportion of the encountered food that is consumed. The feeding level is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f}
  f_i(w) = \frac{E_{i}(w)}{E_{e.i}(w) + h_i(w)},
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(h_i(w)\)</span> is the maximum consumption rate. This is changed with <code><a href="../reference/setMaxIntakeRate.html">setMaxIntakeRate()</a></code>. By default mizer assumes an allometric form <span class="math inline">\(h_i(w) = h_i\, w^n.\)</span> The feeding level is calculated with the function <code><a href="../reference/getFeedingLevel.html">getFeedingLevel()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The rate at which food is consumed is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
(1-f_i(w))E_{i}(w)=f_i(w)\, h_i(w).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="metabolic-losses" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#metabolic-losses" class="anchor"></a>Metabolic losses</h2>
<p>Some of the consumed food is used to fuel the needs for metabolism and activity and movement, at a rate <span class="math inline">\({\tt metab}_i(w)\)</span>. By default this is made up out of standard metabolism, scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and loss due to activity and movement, scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[{\tt metab}_i(w) = k_{s.i}\,w^p + k_i\,w.\]</span> See the help page for <code><a href="../reference/setMetabolicRate.html">setMetabolicRate()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The remaining rate, if any, is assimilated with an efficiency <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> and is then available for growth and reproduction. So the rate at which energy becomes available for growth and reproduction is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Er}
  E_{r.i}(w) = \max(0, \alpha_i f_i(w)\, h_i(w) - {\tt metab}_i(w))

</div>
<div id="sec:repro" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#sec:repro" class="anchor"></a>Investment into reproduction</h2>
<p>A proportion <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of the energy available for growth and reproduction is used for reproduction. This proportion should change from zero below the weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{m.i}\)</span> of maturation to one at the asymptotic weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{\infty.i}\)</span>, where all available energy is used for reproduction. This function is changed with <code><a href="../reference/setReproduction.html">setReproduction()</a></code>. Mizer provides a default form for the function which you can however overrule.</p>
</div>
<div id="growth-1" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#growth-1" class="anchor"></a>Growth</h2>
<p>What is left over after metabolism and reproduction is taken into account is invested in somatic growth. Thus the growth rate is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  g_i(w) = E_{r.i}(w)\left(1-\psi_i(w)\right).
\end{equation}\]</span> It is calculated by the <code><a href="../reference/getEGrowth.html">getEGrowth()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>When food supply does not cover the requirements of metabolism and activity, growth and reproduction stops, i.e. there is no negative growth. The individual should then be subjected to a starvation mortality, but starvation mortality is not implemented in mizer at the moment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="mortality" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#mortality" class="anchor"></a>Mortality</h1>
<p>The mortality rate of an individual <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> has three sources: predation mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p.i}(w)\)</span>, background mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{b.i}(w)\)</span> and fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{f.i}(w)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Predation mortality is calculated such that all that is eaten translates into corresponding predation mortalities on the ingested prey individuals.

<p>The predation mortality rate on resource is given by a similar expression as the predation mortality on fish: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mupp}
  \mu_{p}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{jp}.

<a href="#energy-invested-into-reproduction" class="anchor"></a>Energy invested into reproduction</h2>
<p>The total rate of investment into reproduction (grams/year) is found by integrating the contribution from all individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, each of which invests a proportion <span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of their consumption. This total rate of energy investment can then be converted to a total rate of egg production <span class="math inline">\(R_{p.i}\)</span> (numbers per year): <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rp}
  R_{p.i} = \frac{\epsilon}{2 w_0} \int N_i(w)  E_{r.i}(w) \psi_i(w) \, dw,
\end{equation}\]</span> Here the total rate of investment is multiplied by an efficiency factor <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and then dividing by the egg weight <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> to convert the energy into number of eggs. The result is multiplied by a factor <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> to take into account that only females reproduce. This rate of potential egg production is calculated with <code><a href="../reference/getRDI.html">getRDI()</a></code>.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#density-dependence-in-reproduction" class="anchor"></a>Density-dependence in reproduction</h2>
<p>Three important density-dependent mechanisms widely assumed in fisheries models are automatically captured in the mizer model that lead to an emergent stock-recruitment relationship:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>High density of spawners leads to a reduced food income of the spawners and consequently reduced per-capita reproduction.</li>
<li>High density of larvae leads to slower growth of larvae due to food competition, exposing the larvae to high mortality for a longer time, thereby decreasing the survivorship to recruitment size.</li>
<li>High density of fish leads to more predation on eggs and fish larvae by other fish species or by cannibalism.</li>
</ol>
<p>However there are other sources of density dependence that are not explicitly modelled mechanistically in mizer. An example would be a limited carrying capacity of suitable spawning grounds and other spatial effects.</p>
<p>This requires additional phenomenological density dependent contributions to the stock-recruitment. In mizer this type of density dependence is modelled through constraints on egg production and survival. The default functional form of this density dependence is represented by a reproduction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> (numbers per time) that approaches a maximum as the energy invested in reproduction increases, modelled mathematically it is analogous to a <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:R}
  R_i = R_{\max.i} \frac{R_{p.i}}{R_{p.i} + R_{\max.i}},
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R_{\max.i}\)</span> is the maximum reproduction rate of each trait class. This final rate of reproduction is calculated with <code><a href="../reference/getRDD.html">getRDD()</a></code>.</p>
<p>This default <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type is implemented by <code>BervertonHoldRDD()</code> but mizer also provides alternatives <code><a href="../reference/RickerRDD.html">RickerRDD()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/SheperdRDD.html">SheperdRDD()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/constantRDD.html">constantRDD()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/noRDD.html">noRDD()</a></code>. Also, users are able to write their own functions, e.g. <em>hockey-stick</em>. See <code><a href="../reference/setReproduction.html">setReproduction()</a></code> for details.</p>

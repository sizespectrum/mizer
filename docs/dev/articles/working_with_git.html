<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>It initially takes a bit of effort to get the hang of how this works.
Therefore here we will take you through a little exercise that will see
you create a feature branch, make a change to a mizer file, commit that
file and push it to GitHub, and then make a pull request to contribute
the change back to the core mizer code. The change that you will be
making consists of adding your name to the list of people who have set
up a fork of mizer.</p>
<p>We assume that you have set up your working environment and checked
out your mizer fork to your local computer as described in the section
<a href="developer_vignette.html#setting-up-working-environment">Setting
up working environment</a> in the mizer developer guide. If you have not
yet read that section, please do so now and follow all the instructions
there before continuing with this tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="creating-a-branch">Creating a branch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-branch"></a>
</h2>
<p>Initially you will be on the “master” branch of your repository. The
code in this branch of your repository is a perfect copy of the code in
the master branch of the main mizer repository at <a href="https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer</a>. You should always
keep it that way and not commit any changes to this branch.</p>
<p>You should do all our development work in branches that have been
branched off from the master branch. When you start working on a feature
or on a bug fix, start a new branch with a name suggestive of the
feature or fix. In this example, where you will be adding your info to
the list of people who have set up a fork of mizer, let’s call the
branch “add_my_info”.</p>
To create the new branch, first make sure you have selected the master
branch on the “Switch branch” dropdown in RStudio Git panel and then
click the button to the left of that dropdown.
<center>
<img src="images/new_branch_button.png" style="width:30.0%">
</center>
<p>In the dialog box enter the name for your new branch: “add_my_info”.
Leave the remote as “origin” and make sure the “Sync branch with remote”
checkbox is ticked. This means that the new branch will be created not
only on your local repository but also on your GitHub repository. Click
“Create”. You are now on a new branch in your repository, but so far
this branch contains only exactly the same content as the master branch
that you have branched off from.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="editing-a-file">Editing a file<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#editing-a-file"></a>
</h2>
<p>Next you will make an edit to a file. In the “Files” tab in RStudio,
navigate to the “vignette” subdirectory and click on the name
“developer_vignette.Rmd”. That will open that file in the Source editor
pane. That file is the source file for this developer guide, written in
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" class="external-link">R Markdown</a> format.</p>
A good way to navigate within files is to use the document outline which
will be displayed when you hit the right-most icon on the editor pane
toolbar.
<center>
<img src="images/outline.png" style="width:30.0%">
</center>
<p>You will find the subheading “People with a mizer fork” towards the
bottom of the outline. Clicking on it will move to the corresponding
section of the file. You can now add another bullet point with your name
and interests.</p>
<p>This is an R Markdown file, so you can compile it by clicking on the
“Knit” button on the editor toolbar. This will also save your changes to
the disk. After a short while the resulting html file will be displayed
in an RStudio viewer which will allow you to check the formatting of
your bullet point.</p>
<p>If you had made changes to the actual R code of mizer, then you would
of course also rebuild mizer from that new code by clicking “Install and
Restart” on the “Build” pane of RStudio to test it, and would in
particular run the automated unit tests by hitting Ctrl+Shift+T.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="committing-your-changes">Committing your changes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#committing-your-changes"></a>
</h2>
So far you have only saved your changes to your local disc, but have not
yet committed it to your local repository. To do that you click on the
“Commit” button on the toolbar in the “Git” pane in RStudio:
<center>
<img src="images/commit_button.png" style="width:40.0%">
</center>
This will pop up a screen like the following:
<center>
<img src="images/commit.png" style="width:70.0%">
</center>
<p>The blue M to the left of the file vignettes/developer_vignette.Rmd
indicates that this file has been modified on your hard disc. The files
with the question mark are files that are in the project directory but
not part of the repository. You now tick the file that you want to
commit to the repository. In the above screenshot the file
vignettes/developer_vignette.Rmd has already been selected and as a
consequence, the lower half of the pop-up window shows the modifications
that have been made in the file. You should see your additions in
green.</p>
<p>At the top right of the pop-up window you enter the commit message
that will allow you and others later to understand the purpose of this
commit. It is really useful to put a meaningful message here. The first
time you make a commit to a new branch, you may want to write an
extended commit message that explains what the new branch is for.</p>
<p>When you are happy with everything, hit the “Commit” button. Now your
changes are forever saved in the history of your local repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="pushing-and-pulling">Pushing and pulling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pushing-and-pulling"></a>
</h2>
<p>So far you have only committed your changes to the local repository
on your computer. The changes have not yet been synchronised with your
repository on GitHub. To do that, you click on the “Push” button on the
toolbar of the “Git” pane, the one that looks like an up arrow. A window
will pop up that will confirm if that push worked alright. You can then
close that window.</p>
After you have pushed your changes, you will be able to see them also on
GitHub. If you go to the home page of your GitHub repository you will
see a comment that you made a commit a little while ago:
<center>
<img src="images/recently_pushed.png" style="width:80.0%">
</center>
<p>It may be that you have several computers on which you work an you
can have a local repository on every one of them. In that scenario, it
may be that you have pushed changes onto your GitHub repository from
another computer. You will then not be able to push your new changes
from your current computer until you have pulled those changes onto your
current computer. You do that by hitting the “Pull” button that looks
like a down arrow right next to the “Push” button. That will incorporate
any changes from GitHub into your local repository and this will
generally go smoothly. Only in the case where you have edited the same
lines of the same file on different machines can you run into conflicts
that git can not resolve automatically. In order to avoid such
conflicts, you should pull and push frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="making-a-pull-request">Making a pull request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#making-a-pull-request"></a>
</h2>
<p>Once a feature is developed and tested, you will want to merge it
into the master branch of the upstream repository at <a href="https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer</a>. You can however
not push your changes directly to that repository. Instead you create a
GitHub pull request. This will then get a code review from another mizer
developer before one of the developers with write access to the main
repository merges your changes.</p>
<p>Due to this extra code review before any changes are integrated into
the core mizer code, you do not have to be hesitant with making pull
requests. In case there is anything wrong with your changes, you will
get friendly feedback from other developers. You can then make more
changes and commit them to the same branch and your pull request will
automatically get updated.</p>
<p>The pull request is easy to create using the GitHub web
interface:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the home page of your forked repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Select the branch via the “Branch” drop-down.</li>
<li>Click the “New pull request” button next to that drop-down.</li>
</ol>
<p>Go ahead an create a pull request for your “add_my_info” branch.</p>
<p>Once your pull request has been reviewed and accepted by a developer
and your changes have thus been merged into the upstream master branch,
you can delete your development branch. There is a delete button on
GitHub to delete a branch (for example on the page listing all your
branches). You also need to delete the branch separately in your local
repository by issuing</p>
<pre><code>git branch -d add_my_info</code></pre>
<p>from the terminal, where `add_my_info’ is the name of the development
branch. In addition you may want to tell your local repository that the
remote branch has disappeared as well:</p>
<pre><code>git remote prune origin</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise it will stay in RStudio’s list of remote branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="merging-from-upstream">Merging from upstream<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#merging-from-upstream"></a>
</h2>
<p>Once your pull request, or any pull request by anyone else with a
mizer fork, has been merged into the upstream repository, the master
branch in your fork is no longer in sync with the upstream master
branch. So you will want to merge those upstream changes into our master
branch. To do that you can use the “Terminal” pane in RStudio, where you
execute the following git commands:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master</code></pre>
<p>Again, unless you locally changed the same line in the same file that
someone else changed in the upstream repository, the merging will be
automatic. You should then push the merged master branch back to your
GitHub repository with the “Push” button.</p>
<p>If you get an error when attempting to fetch from upstream then the
upstream repository may not yet have been set for your repository. You
can check with</p>
<pre><code>git remote -v</code></pre>
<p>If that does not list an upstream, then execute the command</p>
<pre><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer.git</code></pre>
<p>and then try the above again.</p>
<p>The first time you go through all the above steps, you will think
that you will never grow to like git. What a lot of fuss. What a
circuitous route for your change to make it into the master branch of
your GitHub repository:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>from your editor to your</li>
<li>from your harddrive into your development branch in your local
repository via Commit</li>
<li>from you local repository to your GitHub repository via Push</li>
<li>from your GitHub repository to the main mizer repository via Pull
Request</li>
<li>from the main mizer repository to you local master branch via
merge</li>
<li>from your local master branch to the master branch of your GitHub
repository via Push</li>
</ol>
<p>But this is the best system software developers have come up with to
allow many people to collaborate on the same code.</p>
<p>You may have more than one development branch because you may be
working on several features at the same time or some of your features
are still waiting to have their pull request merged. In that case, after
merging the upstream changes into our master branch, you may also want
to merge them from your master branch into some of your development
branches. For that you just go to the development branch and do</p>
<pre><code>git merge master</code></pre>

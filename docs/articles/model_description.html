<p>On this page we present the details of the mizer model, taking care
to separate the essential features of the model that are hard-coded and
the various possible specialisations for which mizer provides setup
functions. We will provide links to the functions that can be used to
set or change the various model parameters (all collected together in
<code><a href="../reference/setParams.html">setParams()</a></code>) as well as to the functions that calculate the
various ecological rates in the model (all collected together in
<code><a href="../reference/mizerRates.html">mizerRates()</a></code>) because the help pages of these functions
will provide useful additional details.</p>
We will not go into detail of how this model is realised in code. Such
detail will be provided in the <a href="https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/articles/developer_vignette.html">developer
guide</a>. However some details are hidden on this page and you can see
them by clicking on links like the following:

<p>The model assumes that, to a first approximation, an individual can
be characterized by its weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>
and its species number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> only. The
aim of the model is to calculate the size spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>, which is the <em>density</em> of
individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(\int_w^{w+dw}N_i(w)dw\)</span> is the
<em>number</em> of individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the size interval <span class="math inline">\([w,w+dw]\)</span>. In other words: the number of
individuals in a size range is the area under the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span>.</p>
<details><p>Here is a plot of an example size spectrum for two species with <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> on the vertical axis for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> on the horizontal axis.</p>

<p><img src="model_description_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="700"></p>
<p>To represent this continuous size spectrum in the computer, the size
variable <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is discretized into a
vector <code>w</code> of discrete weights, providing a grid of sizes
spanning the range from the smallest egg size to the largest asymptotic
size. These grid values divide the full size range into a finite number
of size bins. The size bins should be chosen small enough to avoid the
discretisation errors from becoming too big. You can fetch this vector
with <code><a href="../reference/w.html">w()</a></code> and the vector of bin sizes with
<code><a href="../reference/w.html">dw()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The weight grid is set up to be logarithmically spaced, so that
<code>w[j]=w[1]*10^(j*dx)</code> for some fixed <code>dx</code>. This
means that the bin widths increase with size:
<code>dw[j] = w[j+1] - w[j] = w[j] * (10^dx - 1)</code>. This grid is
set up automatically when creating a MizerParams object.</p>
<p>In the code the size spectrum is stored as an array <code>N</code>
such that <code>N[i, a]</code> holds the density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w_a)\)</span> at weights <span class="math inline">\(w_a=\)</span><code>w[a]</code>, or, if time
dependence is included, an array such that <code>N[i, a, u]</code> holds
<span class="math inline">\(N_i(w_a,t_u)\)</span>. See
<code><a href="../reference/N.html">N()</a></code>.</p>
<p>Note that, contrary to what one might have expected,
<code>N[i, a]</code> is not the <em>number</em> of individuals in a size
bin but the <em>density</em> at a grid point. The number of individuals
in the size bin between <code>w[a]</code> and
<code>w[a+1]=w[a]+dw[a]</code> is only approximately given as
<code>N[i, a]*dw[a]</code>, where <code>dw[a]= w[a+1]-w[a]</code>.</p>
<p>Of course all these calculations with discrete sizes and size bins
are only giving approximations to the continuous values, and these
approximations get better the smaller the size bins are, i.e., the more
size bins are used. This is why the functions setting up MizerParams
objects allow you to choose the number of size bins
<code>no_w</code>.</p>

<h3 id="traffic-on-the-road-to-adulthood">Traffic on the road to adulthood<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#traffic-on-the-road-to-adulthood"></a>
</h3>
<p>A good way to think about the time evolution of the number density
<span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> is to consider the familiar
situation of traffic density on the roads. A fishâ€™s life is a journey
along the size axis from egg size to size at death. There are many other
fish making the same journey. The speed with which the fish move along
the size axis is their growth rate. This is quite analogous to the speed
of traffic on a road. Just as the speed of cars depends on the density
of other cars on the road, the growth rate of fish depends on the
density of other fish. When the density of cars on a stretch of road is
high, their speed decreases, and this leads to a pile-up and can lead to
traffic jams. Similarly when the density of fish in a size interval is
high, their growth rate goes down due to competition for the same food
sources, and this too can lead to pile-ups and bottlenecks. So one just
has to replace the space variable in a traffic model by size to get an
equation for the fish size spectra.</p>
<p>The additional feature in the evolution of fish densities that is not
present in road traffic density is that fish can die while they are
growing up, and this death rate is also dependent on the density of
other fish.</p>
<p>The time evolution of the number density <span class="math inline">\(N_i(w)\)</span> is described by the McKendrick-von
Foerster equation, which is a transport equation (as one would use for
traffic density) but with an additional loss term due to fish
mortality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w)
N_i(w)}{\partial w}
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w),
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where individual growth <span class="math inline">\(g_i(w)\)</span>
is described below in the <a href="#growth">Growth</a> section and
mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> is described in
the <a href="#mortality">Mortality</a> section.</p>
<p>There is no need for you to understand the mathematical notation used
in this equation to understand its origin: it just says that the rate at
which the number of fish in a size bracket changes is the rate at which
fish grow into the size bracket from a smaller size minus the rate at
which fish grow out of it to a larger size minus the rate at which the
fish in the size bracket die. So to simulate the size spectrum dynamics
we need to specify the growth rates and the mortality rates. This we
will do below. The important point is that these rates depend on the
density of other fish of other sizes, making the size-spectrum dynamics
non-linear and non-local in very interesting ways. The resulting effects
are too complicated to disentangle by pure thought. This is where
simulations with the mizer package come in.</p>
<p>This McKendrick-von Foerster equation is approximated in mizer by a
finite-difference method. This allows the <code><a href="../reference/project.html">project()</a></code>
function in mizer to project the size spectrum forwards in time: Given
the spectrum at one time the <code><a href="../reference/project.html">project()</a></code> function calculates
it at a set of later times.</p>
<p>Of course there also needs to be reproduction into the smallest size
class, otherwise there would be no small fish any more after a while. So
for the smallest size class instead of a rate of growth into the size
class there is a rate of reproduction of new individuals into that size
class. This reproduction will be described below in the <a href="#reproduction">Reproduction</a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="resource-density">Resource density<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#resource-density"></a>
</h3>
<p>Besides the fish spectrum there is also a resource spectrum <span class="math inline">\(N_R(w)\)</span>, representing for example the
phytoplankton. This spectrum starts at a smaller size than the fish
spectrum, in order to provide food also for the smallest individuals
(larvae) of the fish spectrum. By default the time evolution of the
resource spectrum is described by a semi-chemostat equation.</p>
<details><p>The semichemostat dynamics are given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nb}
  \frac{\partial N_R(w,t)}{\partial t}
  = r_R(w) \Big[ c_R (w) - N_R(w,t) \Big] - \mu_R(w) N_R(w,t).
\end{equation}\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(r_R(w)\)</span>
is the resource regeneration rate and <span class="math inline">\(c_R(w)\)</span> is the carrying capacity in the
absence of predation. These parameters are changed with
<code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">setResource()</a></code>. By default mizer assumes allometric forms
<span class="math display">\[r_R(w)= r_R\, w^{n-1}.\]</span> <span class="math display">\[c_R(w)=\kappa\, w^{-\lambda}.\]</span> You can
retrieve these with <code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">getResourceRate()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">getResourceCapacity()</a></code> respectively. It is also possible to
implement other resource dynamics, as described in the help page for
<code><a href="../reference/setResource.html">setResource()</a></code>. The mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_R(w)\)</span> is due to predation by consumers
and is described in the subsection <a href="#resource-mortality">Resource mortality</a>.</p>
<p>Because the resource spectrum spans a larger range of sizes these
sizes Because the resource spectrum spans a larger range of sizes these
sizes Because the resource spectrum spans a larger range of sizes these
sizes are discretized into a different vector of weights</p>
<p>The resource spectrum is then represented by a vector
<code>NResource</code> such that <code>NResource[c]</code> =<span class="math inline">\(N_R(\)</span><code>w_full[c]</code><span class="math inline">\()\)</span>.</p>

<p>Consumers can grow only by consuming prey. In the next few
subsections we will build towards determining the growth rate resulting

</h3>
<p>The rate at which a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> encounters food (mass per time) is
determined by summing over all prey species and the resource spectrum
and integrating over all prey sizes <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span>, weighted by the selectivity factors:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{i}(w) = \gamma_i(w) \int \left(\sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) +
   \theta_{iR} N_R(w_p) \right)
  \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p \, dw_p.
\end{equation}\]</span> This is calculated by
<code><a href="../reference/getEncounter.html">getEncounter()</a></code>. The overall prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w)\)</span> sets the predation power of
the predator. It could be interpreted as a search volume. It is set by
<code><a href="../reference/setSearchVolume.html">setSearchVolume()</a></code>. By default it is assumed to scale
allometrically as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w) = \gamma_i\,
w^q.\)</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> matrix sets the
interaction strength between predators and the various prey species and
resource. It is changed with <code><a href="../reference/setInteraction.html">setInteraction()</a></code>.</p>
<p>The size selectivity is encoded in the predation kernel <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i(w,w_p)\)</span>. This is changed with
<code><a href="../reference/setPredKernel.html">setPredKernel()</a></code>.</p>
<details><p>An important simplification occurs when the predation kernel <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i(w,w_p)\)</span> depends on the size of the
prey <strong>only</strong> through the predator/prey size ratio <span class="math inline">\(w_p/w\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\phi_i(w, w_p)=\tilde{\phi}_i(w/w_p).\]</span>
This is assumed by default but can be overruled. The default for the
predation kernel is the truncated log-normal function <span class="math display">\[
  \label{eq:4}
  \tilde{\phi}_i(x) = \begin{cases}
  \exp \left[ \dfrac{-(\ln(x / \beta_i))^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right]
  &amp;\text{ if }x\in\left[0,\beta_i\exp(3\sigma_i)\right]\\
  0&amp;\text{ otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> is the
preferred predator-prey mass ratio and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i\)</span> sets the width of the predation
kernel.</p>
<p>The integral in the expression for the encounter rate is approximated
by a Riemann sum over all weight brackets: <span class="math display">\[
{\tt encounter}[i,a] = {\tt search\_vol}[i,a]\sum_{k}
\left( n_{R}[k] + \sum_{j} \theta[i,j] n[j,k] \right)
  \phi_i\left(w[a],w[k]\right) w[k]\, dw[k].
\]</span> In the case of a predation kernel that depends on <span class="math inline">\(w/w_p\)</span> only, this becomes a convolution
sum and can be evaluated efficiently via fast Fourier transform.</p>

<p>Some of the consumed food is used to fuel the needs for metabolism

metabolism, scaling with exponent <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and loss due to activity and movement,

<p>The remaining rate, if any, is assimilated with an efficiency <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> and is then available for growth

<p>The mortality rate of an individual <span class="math inline">\(\mu_i(w)\)</span> has three sources: predation
mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p.i}(w)\)</span>, background
mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ext.i}(w)\)</span> and
fishing mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{f.i}(w)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Predation mortality is calculated such that all that is eaten
translates into corresponding predation mortalities on the ingested prey
individuals. Recalling that <span class="math inline">\(1-f_j(w)\)</span> is the proportion of the food
encountered by a predator of species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> that is actually consumed, the rate at
which all predators of species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
consume prey of size <span class="math inline">\(w_p\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pred_rated}
  {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p) = \int \phi_j(w,w_p) (1-f_j(w))
  \gamma_j(w) N_j(w) \, dw.

\]</span></p>
</details><p>The mortality rate due to predation is then obtained as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mup}
  \mu_{p.i}(w_p) = \sum_j {\tt pred\_rate}_j(w_p)\, \theta_{ji}.

the function <code><a href="../reference/getPredMort.html">getPredMort()</a></code>.</p>
<p>External mortality <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ext.i}(w)\)</span> is independent of the

mizer assumes that the external mortality for each species is a constant
<span class="math inline">\(z0_i\)</span> independent of size. The value
of <span class="math inline">\(z0_i\)</span> is either specified as a
species parameter or it is assumed to depend allometrically on the
asymptotic size: <span class="math display">\[z0_i = z0_{pre}
w_{\infty.i}^{1-n}.\]</span></p>

<p>The total rate of investment into reproduction (grams/year) is found
by integrating the contribution from all individuals of species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, each of which invests a proportion
<span class="math inline">\(\psi_i(w)\)</span> of their consumption.
This total rate of energy investment can then be converted to a total
rate of egg production <span class="math inline">\(R_{p.i}\)</span>
(numbers per year): <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rp}
  R_{p.i} = \frac{\epsilon}{2 w_0} \int N_i(w)  E_{r.i}(w) \psi_i(w) \,
dw,
\end{equation}\]</span> Here the total rate of investment is multiplied
by an efficiency factor <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>
and then dividing by the egg weight <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> to convert the energy into number of
eggs. The result is multiplied by a factor <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> to take into account that only
females reproduce. This rate of potential egg production is calculated
with <code><a href="../reference/getRDI.html">getRDI()</a></code>.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="density-dependence-in-reproduction">Density-dependence in reproduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#density-dependence-in-reproduction"></a>
</h3>
<p>Three important density-dependent mechanisms widely assumed in
fisheries models are automatically captured in the mizer model that lead
to an emergent stock-recruitment relationship:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>High density of spawners leads to a reduced food income of the
spawners and consequently reduced per-capita reproduction.</li>
<li>High density of larvae leads to slower growth of larvae due to food
competition, exposing the larvae to high mortality for a longer time,
thereby decreasing the survivorship to recruitment size.</li>
<li>High density of fish leads to more predation on eggs and fish larvae
by other fish species or by cannibalism.</li>
</ol>
<p>However there are other sources of density dependence that are not
explicitly modelled mechanistically in mizer. An example would be a
limited carrying capacity of suitable spawning grounds and other spatial
effects.</p>
<p>This requires additional phenomenological density dependent
contributions to the stock-recruitment. In mizer this type of density
dependence is modelled through constraints on egg production and
survival. The default functional form of this density dependence is
represented by a reproduction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> (numbers per time) that approaches a
maximum as the energy invested in reproduction increases, modelled
mathematically it is analogous to a <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type
function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:R}
  R_i = R_{\max.i} \frac{R_{p.i}}{R_{p.i} + R_{\max.i}},
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R_{\max.i}\)</span> is the maximum reproduction
rate of each trait class. This final rate of reproduction is calculated
with <code><a href="../reference/getRDD.html">getRDD()</a></code>.</p>
<p>This default <em>Beverton-Holt</em> type is implemented by
<code>BervertonHoldRDD()</code> but mizer also provides alternatives
<code><a href="../reference/RickerRDD.html">RickerRDD()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/SheperdRDD.html">SheperdRDD()</a></code>,
<code><a href="../reference/constantRDD.html">constantRDD()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/noRDD.html">noRDD()</a></code>. Also, users are
able to write their own functions, e.g. <em>hockey-stick</em>. See
<code><a href="../reference/setReproduction.html">setReproduction()</a></code> for details.</p>

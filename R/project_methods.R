#' Get encounter rate needed to project standard mizer model
#' 
#' Calculates the rate \eqn{E_i(w)} at which a predator of species \eqn{i} and
#' weight \eqn{w} encounters food (grams/year). You would not usually call this
#' function directly but instead use [getEncounter()], which then calls this
#' function unless an alternative function has been registered, see below.
#' 
#' @section Predation encounter:
#' The encounter rate \eqn{E_i(w)} at which a predator of species \eqn{i}
#' and weight \eqn{w} encounters food has contributions from the encounter of
#' fish prey and of resource. This is determined by summing over all prey
#' species and the resource spectrum and then integrating over all prey sizes
#' \eqn{w_p}, weighted by predation kernel \eqn{\phi(w,w_p)}:
#' \deqn{
#' E_i(w) = \gamma_i(w) \int 
#' \left( \theta_{ip} N_R(w_p) + \sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) \right) 
#' \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p \, dw_p.
#' }{\gamma_i(w) \int 
#' ( \theta_{ip} N_R(w_p) + \sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) ) 
#' \phi_i(w,w_p) w_p dw_p.}
#' Here \eqn{N_j(w)} is the abundance density of species \eqn{j} and
#' \eqn{N_R(w)} is the abundance density of resource.
#' The overall prefactor \eqn{\gamma_i(w)} determines the predation power of the
#' predator. It could be interpreted as a search volume and is set with the
#' [setSearchVolume()] function. The predation kernel
#' \eqn{\phi(w,w_p)} is set with the [setPredKernel()] function. The
#' species interaction matrix \eqn{\theta_{ij}} is set with [setInteraction()]
#' and the resource interaction vector \eqn{\theta_{ip}} is taken from the
#' `interaction_resource` column in `params@species_params`.
#' 
#' @section Details:
#' The encounter rate is multiplied by \eqn{1-f_0} to obtain the consumption rate,
#' where \eqn{f_0} is the feeding level calculated with [getFeedingLevel()].
#' This is used by the [project()] function for performing simulations.
#' 
#' The function returns values also for sizes outside the size-range of the
#' species. These values should not be used, as they are meaningless.
#' 
#' If your model contains additional components that you added with 
#' [setComponent()] and for which you specified an `encounter_fun` function then
#' the encounters of these components will be included in the returned value.
#' 
#' @section Your own encounter function:
#' By default [getEncounter()] calls [mizerEncounter()]. However you can
#' replace this with your own alternative encounter function. If 
#' your function is called `"myEncounter"` then you register it in a MizerParams
#' object `params` with

#' 
#' @section Feeding level:
#' The feeding level \eqn{f_i(w)} is the

#' The encounter rate \eqn{E_i} is passed as an argument or calculated with
#' [getEncounter()]. The maximum intake rate \eqn{h_i(w)} is
#' taken from the `params` object, and is set with

#' As a consequence of the above expression for the feeding level,

#' Project resource using semichemostat model
#' 
#' If you set your resource dynamics to use this function then the time
#' evolution of the resource spectrum is described by a semi-chemostat equation
#' \deqn{\frac{\partial N_R(w,t)}{\partial t} = r_R(w) \Big[ c_R (w) - N_R(w,t) \Big] - \mu_R(w, t) N_R(w,t)}{dN_R(w,t)/d t  = r_R(w) ( c_R (w) - N_R(w,t) ) - \mu_R(w,t ) N_R(w,t)}
#' 
#' Here \eqn{r_R(w)} is the resource regeneration rate and \eqn{c_R(w)} is the
#' carrying capacity in the absence of predation. These parameters are changed
#' with [setResource()]. The mortality \eqn{\mu_R(w, t)} is
#' due to predation by consumers and is calculate with [getResourceMort()].
#' 
#' This function uses the analytic solution of the above equation to calculate
#' the resource abundance at time `t + dt` from all abundances and rates at time
#' `t`, keeping the mortality fixed during the timestep.
#' 
#' To set your model to use semichemostat dynamics for the resource you do
#' ```
#' params <- setResource(params, 
#'                       resource_dynamics = "resource_semichemostat", 
#'                       resource_level = 0.5)
#' ```
#' where you should replace `params` with the name of the variable holding your
#' MizerParams object. You can of course choose any value between 0 and 1 for
#' the resource level.
#' 
#' @param params A [MizerParams] object
#' @param n A matrix of species abundances (species x size)
#' @param n_pp A vector of the resource abundance by size
#' @param n_other A list with the abundances of other components

#' @details 
#' The [balance_resource_semichemostat()] function is called by [setResource()]
#' to determine the values of the resource parameters that are needed to make
#' the replenishment rate at each size equal the consumption rate at that size,
#' as calculated by [getResourceMort()]. It should be called with only one of
#' `resource_rate` or `resource_capacity` and will return a named list
#' with the values for both.

#' Set metadata for a model
#' 
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#' Setting metadata is particularly important for sharing your model with
#' others. All metadata fields are optional and you can also add other fields
#' of your own choosing. If you set a value
#' for a field that already existed, the old value will be overwritten.
#' 
#' In addition to the metadata fields you can set by hand, there are four fields
#' that are set automatically by mizer:
#' 
#' * `mizer_version` The version string of the mizer version under which the
#' model was last saved. Can be compared to the current version which is
#' obtained with `packageVersion("mizer")`. The purpose of this field is that
#' if the model is not working as expected in the current version of mizer,
#' you can go back to the older version under which presumably it was working.
#' * `extensions` A named vector of strings where each name is the name of and
#' extension package needed to run the model and each value is a string giving
#' the information that the remotes package needs to install the correct version
#' of the extension package, see https://remotes.r-lib.org/. This field is
#' set by the extension packages.
#' * `time_created` A POSIXct date-time object with the creation time.
#' * `time_modified` A POSIXct date-time object with the last modified time.
#'
#' @param params The MizerParams object for the model
#' @param title A string with the title for the model
#' @param description A string with a description of the model. This could for
#'   example contain information about any publications using the model.
#' @param authors An author entry or a list of author entries, where each author
#'   entry could either be just a name or could itself be a list with fields
#'   like `name`, `orcid`, possibly `email`.
#' @param url A URL where more information about the model can be found. This
#'    could be a blog post on the mizer blog, for example.
#' @param doi The digital object identifier for your model. To create a doi you
#'   can use online services like https://zenodo.org/ or https://figshare.com.
#' @param ... Additional metadata fields that you would like to add
#' 
#' @return `setMetadata()`: The MizerParams object with updated metadata

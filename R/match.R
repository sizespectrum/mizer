#' Match biomasses to observations
#' 
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#' The function adjusts the abundances of the species in the model so that their
#' biomasses match with observations.
#' 
#' The function works by multiplying for each species the abundance density
#' at all sizes by the same factor. This will of course not give a steady
#' state solution, even if the initial abundance densities were at steady state.
#' So after using this function you may want to use `steady()` to run the model 
#' to steady state, after which of course the biomasses will no longer match
#' exactly. You could then iterate this process. This is described in the
#' blog post at https://bit.ly/2YqXESV.
#' 
#' Before you can use this function you will need to have added a
#' `biomass_observed` column to your model which gives the observed biomass in
#' grams.  For species for which you have no observed biomass, you should set
#' the value in the `biomass_observed` column to 0 or NA.
#'
#' Biomass observations usually only include individuals above a certain size.
#' This size should be specified in a `biomass_cutoff` column of the species
#' parameter data frame. If this is missing, it is assumed that all sizes are
#' included in the observed biomass, i.e., it includes larval biomass.

#'   biomasses will be matched. A vector of species names, or a numeric vector

#' Match yields to observations

#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#' This function has been deprecated and will be removed in the future unless

#' 
#' If you want to match the yields to observations, you should use the
#' matchYield() function from the mizerExperimental package instead, which
#' adjusts the catchability to match the yield rather than by adjusting the
#' biomass.
#' 
#' The function adjusts the abundances of the species in the model so that their
#' yearly yields under the given fishing mortalities match with observations.
#' 
#' The function works by multiplying for each species the abundance density
#' at all sizes by the same factor. This will of course not give a steady
#' state solution, even if the initial abundance densities were at steady state.
#' So after using this function you may want to use `steady()` to run the model 
#' to steady state, after which of course the yields will no longer match
#' exactly. You could then iterate this process. This is described in the
#' blog post at https://bit.ly/2YqXESV.
#' 
#' Before you can use this function you will need to have added a
#' `yield_observed` column to your model which gives the observed yields in
#' grams per year.  For species for which you have no observed biomass, you
#' should set the value in the `yield_observed` column to 0 or NA.
